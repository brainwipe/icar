### The Technomages
Philosophy: Technologist. Members: Over 10 billion. 

The Technomages aim to support home technologists and to aid the spread of learning in technology. Although these aims sound honourable, some of the technology which is supported is considered illegal by the Imperium. Their illegal interests also reach into handling of stolen goods, harbouring known criminals (especially other Technomages) and supplying equipment to known felonious groups (such as The Machine). Although massively Intersector, the majority of the ruling Mages are based in the Turus Cluster, which is home to the Star Fleet. The size and proliferation of science of the colony makes it the perfect hiding place.

What makes the Technomages unique is their standing with the Star Enforcers. Although they are a clandestine society, most of the Mages are good, law abiding, loyal citizens who have the Technomages as a source of job or hobby. The Star Enforcers mostly see them as a harmless organisation that would take a lot of effort to arrest without actually removing many criminals from the streets. 

From time to time, the Technomages can also act as a source of information for the Star Enforcers. If there is any group working against the colony, they often use their criminal contacts to find information that may lead to an arrest. This delicate situation is dependent on each System. On colonies where the Star Enforcer Colonials are lenient, they enjoy a peaceful life. On nearby Systems, things might not be so easy. This difference in Enforcer leniency leads to differing levels of secrecy. In some locations, Technomages may able to meet openly in a bar. Elsewhere, meetings are held quickly in darkened rooms underground.

The Technomages are not a group that are widely known by the public. News providers do not find much interest in geeks and so rarely report them. If the public were to find out that a special arrangement was held between the Star Enforcers and a clandestine group, a public demanded crackdown would fragment the Technomages and drive them under ground.

#### Organisation
The Technomages have a number of ranks which is shown as black bands around a blue strip of cloth called a 'Mobius'. Advancement comes through aiding others, creating innovative pieces of technology or by helping out non-Technomages gratis using technology. Joining the Technomages is by invitation only. The smallest unit of the Mages is a 'Cell' which consists of anything up to 50 people spread across an Orbital, Colony, System or Cluster. A cell works on a similar area of technology (such as Star Craft). 

Where there are many different cells in an area, they are grouped together called a Clan. A Clan usually consists of Cells with very different interests. The Cells within a Technomage Clan share knowledge and look after each other.

A Clan issues awards to their Mages in the form of decoration on their Mobius. Awards are gained when a Mage has excelled in their field by creating a piece of technology or research that furthers the knowledge of humanity. The promotions are shapes that signify different achievements in different Clans but are all celestial objects such as stars, planets, moons, nebulae, black holes etc. Promotion is awarded when the Technomage has an all round commitment by helping others and putting a lot into the Cell's community. 

#### Rumours
The Technomages have been around for an extremely long time, their origins somewhat vague. One rumour is that the Star Sci set up the Technomages to better monitor and control the general public toying with technology. Star Sci are notoriously difficult to contact and have technology far in advance of anything in the public domain. Whether they have their scientists embedded in the Technomages remains a mystery.
Using the Technomages

The Technomages are everywhere and in heavily populated places, there can be thousands. They are useful for identifying unknown bits of technology, sourcing rare pieces of kit and getting hold of experimental systems. Cells where the topic of study gives rise to dangerous illegal technology will be more difficult to contact. High concentrations of Technomages will offset that difficulty.

The Technomages can be contacted through the usual channels of the Undergaia but it's also possible to meet them by attending local technology social gatherings, seminars and exhibitions. If you know to look for the blue bands, they can be found.
