The Botchery Clipper is an excellent example of a rundown Scav, the Botchery clipper was originally commissioned as gas mining tug, pulling huge cannisters, up to 10km long through light jump. The Botchery Clipper was decommissioned from this role in 91992 when it suffered a major structural failure.

The craft lay in a stable orbit around a nearby moon in Dorian. On the opening of Remmar
in 92028, the ship was captured, repaired (to some degree) and took on its current role of
Salvage. The Botchery clipper has no atmosphere capability and a large, slow Grav engine. Although equipped for tugging huge masses in light jumps, the structural state of the Botchery Clipper does not permit such pulling.

Weighing 280kt with a possible additional cargo of 50kt, the Botchery Clipper was created in a time of cheap, tough metals. For surface operations, the Botchery Clipper has an Orbihaul shuttle.

The value of the craft is difficult to estimate and is given as there are thousands of better examples lying dormant in spacecraft graveyards. It is only a powerful emotional attachment that mean that the Botchery Clipper is still used at all.
