Sold in millions, the Nelson is by far the most popular personal defence weapon available. Its light weight construction and sturdy design means that even the uninitiated can fire the Nelson with a good degree of accuracy. Dispensing 5 rounds every 3 seconds, the H1 can decimate most human targets in 6 seconds! Mostly used by paranoid executives and those living on planets with potentially dangerous species of animal.

The Nelson has been around for many years and its simple design there are hundreds of modifications available. However, many of these are created by small, unlicensed companies, thus the quality of parts cannot be guaranteed. Those included above are officially included by Napalm, the main manufacturer.

A compact and light weapon that can survive neglect and produce a reliable shot every time.
