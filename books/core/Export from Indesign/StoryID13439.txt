 General Items Price List
The rule of thumb in Icar is to use the cost of things local to where you are. If a can of Coca Cola is £1 then in Icar a can of soda is £1. The General Items list below is a guide to prices that are not easy to estimate. This is only a guide, prices vary depending on location. The table assumes you are in a colony with average properties (the sort of boring place you would not hang about) and the service is a standard, no frills one.
