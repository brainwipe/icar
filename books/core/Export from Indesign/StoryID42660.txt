John Smith’s Concept
Idealised School Leaver
Aged 18 and leaving school, John, decided to ignore his parent’s advice about taking the job as a handyman on the Star Base. John wanted adventure, to see strange new worlds and feel free to whizz around the stars. Completely intoxicated by the romance of space travel without any conscious thought of the grim realities.
John is naive and his ignorance is complete bliss. He makes friends easily and is very good natured.
Being technically minded, John Smith’s class will be Scav Colony Technician. Beyond his technical abilities, he’s not very clever and has trouble holding down any meaningful long term relationships. He doesn’t deal with people as well as he does machines.
