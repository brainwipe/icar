Imperial Ranks
The Imperium created the rank structure to give command responsibilities across the Star Industries. For example, a Captain in the Fleet outranks a Star Blade in the Enforcers. There are exceptions to the rule, but these are normally based upon the respect for a particular fighting unit.
Steel The lowest of the low. Everyone in training is a Steel. Few people remain a Steel through their whole career.
Blade The first level of responsibility, a Blade is there to motivate the Steels.
Star Blade The first rank to include any sort of command. Star Blades are squad leaders in Star Fleet, area officers in the Star Enforcers and senior researchers in Star Sci.
Miran This is the lowest command rank. When an individual shows a more pronounced talent for the job and the ability to manage and lead, they can become Miran.
Blade Miran Not much different than Miran, shows added responsibility.
Star Miran Not much different from Blade Miran, a Star Miran would normally have 20 to 50 people working under them.
Fire Miran This rank is normally reserved for those people who are on the brink of becoming a Captain. A Fire Miran should be able to do the job of the Captain to whom they are second to.
Captain Normally in command of many people within a single unit. The rank of Captain is normally found as Captain of a Ship or Head of Star Enforcers on a Colony.
Admiral All the Admiral ranks tend to be strategy jobs, rather than tactical jobs. This is the first level such responsibility.
Blade Admiral A indistinguishable step above Admiral.
Star Admiral Normally in command of an area of responsibility, like the Star Fleet Special Forces.
Fire Admiral Most of the Imperial councils are Fire Admirals.
Fire Lord The head of each  Star Industry.
