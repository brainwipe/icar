Psychotheatrics List
1. Uncontrolled Psyonics
Fiery = 5	
You have fiery outbursts and can not explain why supernatural things happen to them. You cannot buy this Pyschotheatric off. The GM is in control of your Psyonics and will use them to your disadvantage as they see fit. See Evolution on page 59.
2. Psychopath	
Fiery = 5, Fearful = 5, Foolhardy = 5, Soul -2, Wit -2	
You rejoice in killing. You fly off the handle often and with an extreme rage. Also, your personality is in flux: except for the three Deviant wheel assets (left), change the Deviant wheel by five points each time the Character is played. When you are put under a stressful situation, make a Soul check. If you pass, you remain in control. If you fail then you become unstable and begin lashing out. You tend not to do so with friends (other PCs) but will certainly attack those not familiar with you (NPCs).
3. Drained	
Choose three Attributes to become same value as lowest Attributes.
You spend your time with people more intelligence, attractive and more socially accepted than you. You�re morose about it and make life difficult. You don�t see the point in life and will always find the pessimistic side to everything. There are times when you feel good and bright but it�s normally when other people are suffering and you are not. After all, there is nothing more delicious than other people�s misery.
4. Pathetic	
Courageous = 1, Meat = 2, Battle = 2, Shift = 2
You�re a genetic throwback to a time when people were small, skinny, weak, slow and pathetic. It�s the hand you were dealt and it defines who you are. You�re going to have to work very hard to pull yourself out of the genetic hole you�ve landed in. You�ve been bullied all your life, or even worse, ignored.
5. Bipolar Personality Disorder
Create 2 Deviant Wheels.
You have a split personality. Decide on what it is that makes you flip between the two forms of you. It should be something that is likely to occur once per session. Ensure that the two Deviant wheels are very different. They can have some similar features but it should be obvious which personality is being played. Close friends will know you�re Bipolar and will understand, others will find it more difficult to understand.
6. Paranoid with good reason
Soul -2, Wit -1.
You are convinced someone is out to get you. That�s because they are. Not only are you paranoid about everyone you meet but you do actually have a past enemy. The GM decides what this enemy is from your past. You can only buy this off once you have dealt with the mystery enemy.
7. Amnesiac	
Wit -3
Every so often (at the end of the session), your short term memory resets and you forget what�s just happened. Medium range memory (5 sessions ago) are quite easy to remember and long term memory is fine. The memories are there, you just can�t get at them.
8. Bionics Rehab Rejection
All Attributes - 2, Poor Borg suit
You were borged by an amateur and you rejected the suit during insufficient Rehab. You are in a recovery suit - where you will remain for 6 months. During this time, all Attributes will be 2 less than your natural levels and you will develop a phobia (GM chooses).
9. Unknown Past
You have no memory before 2 days ago. You know who you are and you know what you can do but beyond that, it�s a mystery. The GM gets to decide on your past, but it will not be beneficial to you.
10. Sociopath
Soul - 3, Suspicious = 5
You do not like socialising and hate large groups of people (require Soul check or you will freak out!). You are fine with those in your trusted circle of friends (the Characters in your team) but you are suspicious of anyone else you meet. Small talk is painful for youand you often find yourself bungling social situations that others would have no problem with.
11. Hunted
Change Deviant Wheel to reflect the associated paranoia.
Someone is out to kill you. Flip a coin and call. If you call correctly, you can decide if you know you�re being hunted. If you call incorrectly, the GM decides. The killer may strike at any time during the campaign.
12. Coward
Soul - 3, Fearful = 5
You will not put yourself into danger and you prefer to run than fight. This is different from passifism, which is a choice. If you are cornered in a terrifying predicament, you are more likely to freeze to the spot or run than to act safely or tactically.
13. Slow To React
Always lose the initiative. Shift -2.
Everyone else is always first to get the joke, respond to a fight or play any game that involves being first to do something. Your reactions are slow and you can�t understand why.
14. Feeble Minded
Wit = 2
You have real trouble understanding concepts and you know you�re not the brightest person there. The world just washes around you. You do not notice detail very well and have real difficulty understanding things other people take for granted. This Psychotheatric may not be bought off.
15. Very Weak
Meat -4, Battle -2
You are physically underdeveloped and small in stature. It is going to take a lot of weights and fighting training to build you back up to normal.
16. Criminal / Enforcer Parents
You parents are either Criminals on the run or are Enforcers (whichever is worst for the setting, flip a coin if equally bad). Either way, you are not allowed to turn to your family for any assistance. You cannot buy this Psychotheatric off as much as you cannot change who your parents are.
17. Technophobe
-30% to all Tech Skill checks.
You are terrified by machines and any kind of technology. When it comes to dealing with machinery (Cars, Bikes, Spacecraft, etc), take a -30% to the Skill. You might be very Skilled at something, you just lack the natural aptitude for dealing with it. The only way ofbuying the Skill off is to have 6 Skills on the Tech tree above 60% before buying it off.
18. Bad Reputation
D10 enemies
People know you and it isn�t good. You�ve already lived a lot of life and most of it has been at the expense of others.You have D10 enemies, 2 of which are obsessive and will be actively looking for you. If you enter a bar in your local area then roll Soul to see if they recognise you. A pass and they do.
19. Hallucinations
Soul -2, Fearful = 4. 2 Hallucinations per session.
You honestly believe the things you see. You also don�t sleep well. You�re not sure about the difference between dreams and reality. The Character must have two hallucinations per session. The player may specify hullucinations but if the idea jar is empty then the GM will specify for them. Hallucinations may be pleasant things but they may worry the team.
20. Liar
Honest = 1, Proud = 5
You lie when discussing deeds or describing stories. You will embellish and then lie to support the embellishments. Far too proud to back down, you will only give up when evidence is shown to prove the contrary - at which point the original lie will be blamed on someone else.
21. Low Pain Threshold
Meat -2. Take twice as much stun.
There�s something about you that just hurts more. It might be your way of life, diet or upbringing that has made you so susceptible to being knocked out. 
22. Selfish
Soul -1, Selfish = 5
You won�t share anything, even with close friends. You like to hoard anything you can carry and will hide useful things in places others cannot find. If a situation looks like it can work out well for the team and you then that�s great but you won�t seek out those situations. Be careful to not let the rest of the team see the results of these Selfish tendancies, else you might be cast from the group.
23. Headcase
Serious = 1, Firery = 4, Foolhardy = 5	
You are hooked on adrenaline and trouble. You love causing problems, getting into tight situations and being trouble to everything and everyone. If something looks simple, complicate it. If the situation looks safe, endanger everyone. 
24. Average
2 lowest and 2 highest Attributes become 3.
You are painfully normal and average. This has the small bonus of often going un-noticed. You are plain looking, have lived a standard and outright boring life. You will have to invent a reason why you have managed to mix with such interesting people.
25. Short Concentration Span
Wit - 2, Serious = 2
You are scatter brained and have trouble concentrating on many tasks. Especially boring ones. A task anything longer than 15 seconds. Every 4 combat rounds, make a Soul check. If you fail, then you lose 3 seconds while your mind is elsewhere.
26. Clumsy
Shift -2, Battle -2
You don�t have much spatial awareness, you knock things over a lot and have little co-ordination.
27. Narcoleptic
You have no idea but you randomly fall asleep. Once asleep, you wake up after a short time and are wide awake instantly. It�s not triggered by stress, tiredness or alcohol. It lasts for D10 minutes and occurs twice every session.
28. Bullied
Humble = 4, Courageous =2, Battle=3
You were always bullied and your Character is humbled by it. Without pride or self-confidence, you find it difficult to assert yourself.
29. Babbling Fool
Wit -1, Soul -2
When in stressful situations, you sometimes start talking incessently. You can�t stop yourself. You might give away vital information. When under any stress, roll Soul and if you fail then you start babbling inanely.
30. Short Fuse
Firery = 5	
You are easily made angry, anyone in disagreement with you or mocking you will feel your wrath. You do calm down just as quickly but for a short time, you are impossible to deal with. When something annoys you, roll Soul with a Hard difficulty to lose your temper. When the situation around you mellows, roll Soul again to regain control.
31. Kleptomaniac
You can not stop stealing things. They do not have to be of use, but if you think you can get away with lifting something, you will. You don� like to sell the things on, you just like collecting them.
32. Megalomaniac
Wit -1, Soul -1
You want to have power over people. you want to feel them beg at your knees. You want controlling influence over their lives. This is intoxicating. You will always want to push yourself into the lead and want to make decisions for th team as a whole. When they do not allow it, you will work to make it your goal to be in control.
33. Vertigoic Agoraphobic
Also know as Groundhog disease, it is a fear of being outside Spacecraft or Space Stations. Someone suffering from this will not like being on a planet�s surface without being surrounded by a spacecraft and would not want to do any zero-g space walking. This is a modern condition that affects many people. 
34. Pig Ugly
Soul -1
You are unattractive in the extreme. There is no galactic subculture that would think you were attractive. Your looks are never back in fashion. Your face is lopsided and head mishapen. You are just really very ugly. People might feel sorry for you, some might be outright disgusted. You get -20% modifier on any Skill that involves human relations. You can buy this Psychotheatric off with cosmetic surgery.

Soul -1
You have two habits that other people might find annoying.When under stress, one of these habits should manifest itself.
36. Itchy Trigger Finger
Foolhardy = 4, Firery = 4, Wit -1
You like shooting things. You are likely to be the first to open fire, even when it is not appropriate. You�re forever drawing and loading your gun and that often makes people edgy. Edgy people often make mistakes, which is why you need to open fire.
37. Susceptible to Immersive Coma
Soul -1
Your mind does not differentiate between the real world and Gaia. Although you cannot be harmed in Gaia, there is a chance that when something truly incredible happens, your senses become overloaded and you pass out. Whenever the situation is looking intense, pass a Soul check to remain conscious. You are only unconscious for 5 minutes or until someone wakes you.
38. Unforgiving
Soul + 1, Merciless = 5, Vengeful=5
You enjoy applying pain to people and seeing people go through horrors. You are the archetypal sadist who will hunt people down to apply your own particular brand of cruelty to them.
39. Criminal Connections
You have friends in the underworld. This can be both advantageous and disadvantageous. Pick up two good contacts you can rely on and 2 enemies that are looking for you. You do know who these people are and can avoid them if needed. When you need a new criminal contact, roll Streetwise on Hard. If you buy this Psychotheatric off, you lose both the contacts and the enemies.
40. Nightmares
Soul -1
You don�t sleep well and get horrible nightmares. Often this might have repercussions on your behaviour when awake. Sometimes, you have nightmares that come true, they are only bad ones. The GM will tell you when a bad situation was a nightmare you had. Then roll Soul. On a pass, the GM can give you a hint to help you out. On a fail, you are frozen to the spot for as many turns as your Soul.
41. Slow Learner	
Wit - 1
You need 2 RP to raise a Skill by 3%, rather than 1 RP. You may not justify any tenuous raises. To buy this Psychotheatric off, you must get two Skills to 90% (maximum).

43. String of failed relationships
Soul +1, Virtuous=2, Loving=4
You love people just a little too much. So much, in fact, that you have had so many relationships in the past that you have a string of failed ones.

44. Chaos Lust
Wit +1, Soul -1	
Normality scares you. Order and conformity set your teeth on edge. Whenever the pace of life slows or you�re set into a situation where everyone is towing the party line, you�ll seek to liven things up. This could be as little as breaking a glass �accidentally� at a dinner party to blowing up someone�s prized car. A failed Soul check will start the lust for chaos.
45. Notorious

The shape of your face, the timbre of your voice, the gleam of your smile gives you the appearance of a trustworthy individual. So trustworthy, that you have the ability to weave utter lies in the face of insurmountable evidence. Not only does this make you excellent at Persuasion but whenever you are trying to get someone to believe an utter lie, perform a Soul check and on a pass, the lie is believed.

Your gift is one of precise and detailled recall from memory. The tiny details that others might miss all get stored in your memory and you have the ability to read them out. If you find that there was a piece of information you wish you had collected from a previous scene then you can retrieve this information with a successful Wit roll.

88. Halo Effect
Soul +1, +10% to any Skill roll involving human interaction. +20 to Seduce Skill and free if not yet owned.

89. Spatially Aware
Does not take detrimental firing modifiers

90. Parent is Imperial Peer
Soul + 2
One of your parents is an Imperial Lord / Lady. They have a great amount of resources and contacts to call upon if required. You may very well want to keep this fact secret as it might be used against you.

Wit = 10. 2% on every Skill increase.
Who can say what being a genius is? You can see things much quicker than anyone else and can pick up just about anything  much quicker than anyone else. Add 2% on top of any addition to a Skill advance either by Roleplaying Points or by instantaneous GM increase.

Shift = 10, Battle + 2, always wins the initiative
You have incredible natural speed, almost bionic! You always win the initiative and also can not be caught by surprise by anyone in a fight.
93. Expert Listener
You are exceptional at hearing what people say and then understanding the hidden undertones. When talking to NPCs, if you feel that the Gamesmaster is not giving the full story, do a Soul check and on a pass, the Gamesmaster must give the subtext or state if there is a subtext or not. Sometimes NPCs do tell the truth! Can be used once a Session.
94. Born Warrior
Shift = 10, Battle = 10

96. Overlord
You have someone watching that will not allow you to come to any harm. You�re not sure they exist but will help you at times of need. The Gamesmaster will create an NPC they can use in times of need. It�s not something you can control.
97. Last Action Hero
There is something unreal about the cavalier way in which you lead your life. It�s not luck, instead you are surrounded by a sort of aura by which the universe itself is rooting for you.
Once per session, during an action sequence (such as combat) you may say �I don�t think so� to the GM and whatever nasty thing was about to happen to you will not happen. This can only be used for you, not any other character. Examples include not taking any damage, the enemy running out of ammo at the worst possible time, losing the initiative and so on.
98. I�ve Done This On Gaia
Your Character has spent a lot of time in very accurate Gaia simulations and a lot of it has rubbed off. Not only have you picked up lots of parts of Skills but you are able to recall them on a whim when in tight situations. When you are faced with an action and do not have a Skill for it, make Soul and Wit checks, if both pass then you can perform the action just once. If presented with the same problem again, you have to roll again.
99. That Bastard Everyone Hates to Love
Battle = 10, Shift = 10, Meat = 10, Wit = 10, Soul = 3
You�re exceptionally talented. Intelligent, attractive, strong, fast and good in a fight. You are the pinacle of human evolution. You are that which everyone aspires to be.

100. Genus 3	
Psyonics
You have psyonics and you can control them on a simple level. By practising you can improve your psyonics. You get to control what gets triggered but the GM will decide the outcome. See Evolution on page 59.
