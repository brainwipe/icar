The space craft community scoffed when Endotek announced that they were to release a large, luxury freighter. Previous attempts had often proved the folly of smaller companies but Endotek had both the skill and the good name to produce such a vessel. Clever marketing meant that the Cyclone attained almost mythical kudos - strange for a vessel that is powered by very standard systems. 

The luxury element is provided by the well thought out complexity of the design and the attention to detail, both in crew apartments and in the main bay areas. As a freighter, it is not large enough to carry the very big trade contracts but can move sufficiently large items long distances very quickly. 

Now admired with an almost lovestruck following of owners and fans alike, the Cyclone sales remain strong, proving that Endotek can compete in the freighter market, even if it is on their own terms.
