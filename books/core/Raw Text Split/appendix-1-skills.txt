Task Skill List
Task Skill Tree

Pilot
Wit Wit Shift. Self Taught.
Pilot Skills allow a Character to drive, fly or ride any vehicles. Most everyday driving does not require a roll. If the pilot needs to deal with heavy weather or heavy traffic then the difficulty modifier is Hard. Each vehicle is classed approximately below, however, to operate all the functions of some vehicles, it may be necessary to have more than one Skill.
Example: The Zyntek Eagle is a Grav car. So comes under the Pilot Grav Skill. If the pilot wishes to take it into space, which is one of its capabilities, then the pilot must also have Pilot Cruiser.
Vehicle Classifications
Bike. A vehicle that the rider straddles
Grav. A small car or van.
Heavy Grav. Heavier grav vehicles such as Haulers and Grav Fighters.
