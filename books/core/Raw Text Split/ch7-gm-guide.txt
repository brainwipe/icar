Gamesmaster Guide
Welcome Gamesmaster (GM), this section will help you run Icar. Avoid sharing information from this Section with the players (unless their Characters discover it). This guide is written in an authoritarian style, not to impose laws but to keep it brief and make it easier to use as reference. Anything in this guide or the rules is open to interpretation and bending to meet the needs of your group is encouraged. 
The GM Section is split into the following sections:
Understand This Before You Play describes some home truths about the Icar system, what to expect.
System Mechanics gives more examples of play and how to best apply the rules.
Characters explains Skill use and how much RP to give out.
Background expands upon the background given in the main section with details that the players do not need to know (or will find out during play).
Running an Icar Sandbox explains how to run an Icar campaign the way Rob Lang does.
Scavenger Setting Gamesmaster Notes gives extra information for the Scavenger Setting and applies the tools given in this section.
Understand this before you play
Icar is designed for a sandbox Campaign play. A campaign is a series of adventures played back to back with the same player Characters and recurring NPCs. A sandbox is where the players get to choose what they do next.
Ideally, 5 players (which will be assumed from here on).
The combat system is lethal.
Don�t try and use all the mechanics in the first session.
Mechanics
Combat
The aim of the combat system is to provide fast and loose scenes while still having to make tactical choices. It is not recommended that you use a battle map with miniatures. This is because combat will happen in four dimensions: a player character wrestling a suspect to the floor, a firefight with the guards, drive by fire support and Hacking doors closed over Gaia. It�s much easier to represent that on a scribbled map with a grid to help represent scale. Rely upon description in scene setting rather than where miniatures are places on a grid.
The Importance of Scene Setting
All of the combat systems in Icar require you to set the scene before combat begins. By setting the scene well, you will find that the players will get involved in describing the combat, rather than simply rolling dice and reporting damage.
Poor Scene Setting Example. The bad guy is an armed Borg. Byrnie, you are here. The door is here. There is a table in the middle of the room.
There is little here for the players to latch onto except the target. By adding some extra detail, you can help the players make much more descriptive actions.
Better scene setting example: The bad guy is a Borg, he is carrying a huge gun in his right hand. Byrnie, you are here by the door control panel. There is a office table here, the Mesh exits are here and here. There is a cracked window behind the Borg. The ceiling is 3m high.
By adding a little more description, you are prompting the player to think about the decision. There is a little guiding here, hinting that the player might want to leave. Too much explanation �fluff� such as the colour of the walls will take too long. If the player asks questions to further define the area, that is fine but answer quickly and press for a decision.
Close Combat
Close Combat is a descriptive affair. Characters punch, kick, head butt, dodge and more. It is a very visual form of combat. If the player wishes to make use of the environment in close combat, that is fine too.
Example: The PC has the enemy in a hold and they are standing next to a wall. The enemy has not managed to break free. The player chooses to use a punch-punch-punch combo next turn but would like to slam the enemy into the wall. In a real fight, that might be tricky but it does show that the player is taking the situation into account so ask for a Street Fighting roll and the wall becomes a blunt weapon.
Descriptive words
When describing the blows taken and given in close combat, it can help to add some adjectives. Head butts can crack, kicks might thud and punches can slap. Below is a micro-thesaurus of words you might use. Encourage your players to describe the punches. 
If the player uses the environment  to build flavour into the combo, then reward them by doing extra Stun.
Cheat Sheets
In the Appendix are quick reference �cheat sheets�. They duplicate the salient points of the rules. Nothing secret is printed on the cheat sheets, so you may share them with the players.
Fire Fighting
Weapons in Icar are lethal but medicine and armour are powerful. If you put unarmoured, unarmed Characters up against just about anyone with a pistol, they are going to have pieces shot off. Always have a medic on hand because the medic�s Skills and equipment are vital. If the players shun the idea of playing a medic (which is reasonable), then add one in as an NPC or run a less-lethal campaign. An Automaton is a good choice for a medic because Automatons cannot hurt people and are comparatively strong and easy to repair.
To simplify the bad guys rolling to hit, assume that every bad guy has a Skill of 60. Roll your hits on a D100 still but 60 is the value you must get under.
To easily work out how much an NPC is dealing in damage, assume that they are firing the weapon with the full number of rounds per turn. If the weapon�s Blast Factor (BF) is higher than the player Character�s Armour Rating (AR) then the Character takes all of it. If the BF is less than the AR, they take a 10th. Just knock off a zero from the end of the damage.
Characters
Using Skills
When using a Skill for Character knowledge, only one Character may roll per question asked of the GM. For example, if a Character asks �Who is the council chairman on this colony?� and fails their roll, no other player may roll dice for this question. If they want to ask a different, connected question they may.
Handing out Roleplaying Points
The intended length of a campaign should govern the amount of Roleplaying Points you hand out. For a short game, you hand out more each session to allow the Characters to grow at a quicker rate. For longer campaigns, you give less to avoid the Characters becoming very powerful early on.
Players play for reward. Whatever you hand out Roleplaying Points for, that is what they will play to. If you hand out Roleplaying Points for killing things or having grand experiences, then they will do more of that. In Icar, it is recommended that you hand out RP for:
Believably roleplaying a consistent Character
Having good ideas
Putting effort into the campaign
You do not hand out RP for:
Completing jobs
Successfully completing tasks
Killing
How much RP to hand out
For a 3 hour session, 50 session campaign, I give out RP using the following scale. Each entry of the scale assumes the last entry is met - for example, for 2 RP, the player needs to have turned up to the session as well as playing a believable Character.
1 RP: Player turned up to the session.
2 RP: Player joined in when prompted.
3 RP: Player played a believable Character and joined in often without prompting.
4 RP: Player had good ideas and was convincing in Character.
5 RP: Player put maximum amount of effort, powered the team forward and roleplayed their Character in such a way that it was if the Character was sitting there.
Other things I reward:
+1 RP: If the group take command of their own destiny and rather than being fed information, go and find it themselves.
+1-3 RP: Downtime. Between sessions, encourage the players to discuss the events of the session and do any planning. Email, forums, Google+, Facebook or Twitter are all good ways of organising this. The aim is to reduce the amount of time spent shopping, planning, scheming and not roleplaying when at the table. If the downtime enriches the game, adds back story or allows more play to be done at the table, I award RP for it.
+1-3 RP: Recap. When recapping the last session (see Organising your Game Session on page 114), an entertaining recap performed from the point of view of the Character will gain 3 RP. A simple list of events will get 1 RP.
Putting a Team Together
For low powered Characters, it is imperative that the team has a broad range of Skills. This ensures that the team won�t get stuck because they are missing a vital Skill. Also, tightly defined Skill packages mean that every Character has a specific job in the team. That makes it easier for you to ensure that a session requires all the Skills of the team.
As Characters develop, there will be cross-over in Skill sets but by that time, each Character will be filling a social role (peace maker, trouble maker, clown etc) as well as their Skill role. 
Every Character should have the following Skills - if they do not, have a good reason for it:
Gaia Know, Streetwise, Pilot Grav
A typical team would consists of:
1 x Combat monster - Street Fighting, Light Firing, Heavy Firing perhaps Rail Fighting.
1 x Space Tech Geek - Spacecraft Know/Systems/Design, Pilot Cruiser, Automaton Know/Systems
1 x Not-Space Geek - Vehicle Know/Systems/Design, Weapon Know/Systems/Design, Pilot Heavy Grav
1 x Gaia Hacker - Gaia Know/Systems/Hacking
1 x Verbal Character - Persuade, Intimidate, Language, Street Trading
Background
Icar has a lot of background and like the world you�re living in now, you don�t need all of it at once. For new Gamesmasters, jump straight to the Scavenger Setting and work from that, you can then pick and choose from the extra information here when you run low on ideas from the Scavenger Setting.
Using the Droids
Unless you run a military campaign where they are the focus, Droids are not meant to be a core part of an Icar campaign. Instead, they provide background flavour and richness to the setting. News reports list �Gains and Losses�, which are Clusters and systems that have been taken from or lost to the Droids, people gossip about recent footage and rumours spread of new Droid capabilities that the Star Fleet cannot deal with. They should be used rarely and with considerable fanfare.
The Droids perform three main tasks in Icar.
1. They provide a �bogeymen� that NPCs will have varying levels of fear of. Most are fascinated and terrified by them, some are complacent, arrogant or ignorant. Anyone who has had any contact with the Droids are likely to be in fear of them. The news reports will be from distant systems and the problem of the Droids will feel detached from day to day life. Parents may use Droids as impetus to get their children to sleep or eat healthily.
2. They create a soft border to better fix the area in which the Characters can go. Trips outside the three Human Occupied Sectors of Sayshell, Dorian and Remmar should be rare and is very dangerous. Droids are not a imagined propaganda device of the Imperium to keep everyone in line, they are very real and very lethal.
3. They provide a rare challenge. Characters with medium power weapons (Astrarippers, ChainSAWs or Energy Weapons) could stumble upon a damaged Droid on a wrecked spacecraft (see Scavenger Setting on page 97). For more powerful Characters, a fully operational Droid (or a pod of Droids landing on a planet the players favour) is more of a challenge. If you want to terrify the players into leaving a planet in a hurry, try a full on Droid invasion. Be careful not to invade a planet too close to Sayshell or you�ve broken the setting. A pod might get there but not a Droid Cruiser.
Droid Statistic Examples
If you desperate to use Droids in your campaign, here are some broad statistics for the two most common, the bipedal humanoid Mark 1 and the Mark 3. For weaponry, use the statistics for any of the Chain Guns (e.g. Astraripper 2E, Chainsaw 7, Korg 5) or energy weapons (e.g. Photoscythe). Any future supplements detailing Droid campaigns should supplant this section.
Simple Droid examples (use in rare cases only!)
Statistic	Mark 1	Mark 3
Armour Rating (AR)	50	60
Head	5000	8000
Left Arm	4000	6000
Torso	9000	15 000
Right Arm	4000	6000
Left Leg	5000	10 000
Right Leg	5000	10 000
Shields	6	14

Alien Races
Other worlds have managed to produce sentient animals, not too dissimilar to those on Earth (mammoths, fish, birds, etc). However, none of the animals have an intelligence beyond an Earth dog. There are no other races travelling between the stars. Aliens can be very cunning and lethal but they are animal in nature. Alien races can be used for �bug hunt� purposes, like in the film Aliens.
Creating your own Cluster Maps
As a GM, you might decide to use your own Cluster and draw your own maps. The steps to create your own cluster are:
Print a blank Cluster Map
You will find it in the Appendix.
Choose a Sector
Begin by choosing a cluster on the Sector maps (Sayshell, Remmar and Dorian).
Clusters in Sayshell are tidy, clean, well organised, prone to highly organised crime, high tech.
Clusters in Dorian are industrial, functional and wealthy.
Clusters in Remmar are frontier worlds.
Alternatively, you could set up your Cluster as a fish-out-of-water, such as a rich and neat system in Remmar.
Mark nearest Hub/Rim/Spin lines
To help place your cluster on the Sector map, mark the nearest Hub/Rim or Spin lines (the horizontal and vertical grid lines on the Sector map) on the map. You should only need to mark one of each on.
Draw the outline of the cluster
Roughly draw the outline of the cluster on the graph.
Add systems in groups
For each colony you want in your cluster, place a circle in one of the grid squares. More interesting story arcs can be created if you try grouping systems together and them leaving space between them.
Creating your own Skeletons
A Skeleton is a package of training and equipment that defines the kind of role the Character has in the team. If you are creating your own Setting or need some more Skeletons to fit into a pre-made Icar setting then you might need to create your own Skeletons. There is no �right� way to build a Skeleton, it depends on your setting. There are some general guidelines that can help you get started.
The guidelines assume that the Characters are going to start off as young, simple characters. If you are running a campaign that jumps in with Characters that have been around longer, then see the Section �Experienced Characters�.
Anatomy of a Skeleton
A Skeleton consists of:
Description. A general overview of the role the Skeleton represents. 
Suggested Attributes. Most Skeletons will have Attributes that best suit it. For example, a medic should have a high Wit.
Skills. Give you Skeletons enough skills to be useful but not too many or there isn�t room for the Character to grow.
Equipment. Weapons, technology, bionics and armour.
Choosing Core Skills
A Skeleton should have a purpose that is not already covered by an existing Skeleton. Core Skills are those Skills that most Characters should have (and there be a good reason why if not). Here are a few examples:
Did they go to a Star Civilisation School?
Most children do. School is a matter of attending classes over Gaia and having irregular tutorials. If you can get to a Gaia terminal, you can go to school. If they come out School, they will know the following:
Law 
History 
Biology 
Physical 
Chemical 
Gaia Know
Have they been an adult living a normal life in Human Occupied Space?
Adults living under the Imperium will have picked up some basic skills. Note that this is not the case for Scavenger Setting characters.
Pilot Grav
Streetwise
Have they lived on a spacecraft for a long time?
Living on a spacecraft for a long time means that you will have a thorough grounding in how they work.
Zero-G Operations (from Scav Setting)
Spacecraft Know
Choosing Vocational Skills
Vocational Skills are the Skills that make this Character individually useful in the Team. To decide on which vocational Skills to give the Skeleton, look through each of the Skills and ask yourself the question: �Do they need this for their job?�. For Technical roles, this is quite easy as the type of Technical character (Spacecraft Tech or Vehicle Tech) will have its own Skill branch. For Technical Characters, give all the Skills in Branch.
Starting Skill Values
The starting values for Skills should be considered in three groups: Schooled, Vocation and Extras. As the Character is fresh to the game, the starting values do not have to obey the rules for buying new Skills. For example, do not worry that a medical character has 70% in their Surgery Skill but only 50% in their Medical Basic Skill.
Schooled Skills
These are skills that the Character will have learned at school  (See Did they go to a Star Civilisation School?) but they are unlikely to be highly skilled in them. In this case, the skills take their starting values from the Skill list in the Appendix.
Vocational
A Character�s specialism is what makes them uniquely useful in the team. The starting values depend on the Attributes associated with the Skill and their Epoch. For each Skill, follow these steps:
Pick one Attribute you feel represents the Skill.
For Epoch 1 Skills, you�re aiming for a 40-60% range, so 5 x (Chosen Attribute) + 2D10.
For Epoch 2 Skills, you�re aiming for a 30-50% range, so 3 x (Chosen Attribute) + D10
For Epoch 3 (and higher), use the Starting Value of the Skills.
Extra Skills
These are Skill you feel the Skeleton has to make it more useful. For example, the Scavenger Setting Human Resources Skeleton has Empathy and Persuade skills. Although these are not required to do the job, they make the non-combat Character that more useful. 
Extras should start at 3 x (Chosen Attribute) + D10.
Equipment, Bionics and Armour
Only the bare minimum equipment should be given out. Much of the fun of Icar is collecting technology as the game progresses. 
If your player group are used to (and like) long Character generation sessions then do not list Equipment and give them a budget of 10 000 credits instead. Bionics and Armour should also be specified using a budget, letting the players choose what they want from their characters.
Experienced Characters
For Experienced Characters, create the Skeletons as normal and then give the players 20 RP and 10 000 credits to spend for every year of experience they have had. The RP may only be spent on Skills and Attributes (if justified). When actually playing, Characters will gain a lot more RP per year but that is because as played Character is a lot more exposed to interesting situations than the common person.
Skeletonless Method (Optional)
If you would prefer the players to choose the whole make-up of their character, you can allow them to buy everything from scratch. This might be a very long process. If the player decides not to take common schooling skills, they will have to justify that with background. Once Attributes are set (either through Random roll or Point Assign) give the players 270 Roleplaying Points and 20 000 credits to spend on their Characters. Use the usual RP spending rules.
Warning: This system is open to abuse, ensure that you remind the players that their Character choices need to be ratified by you.
Running an Icar sandbox
This section explains how to run Icar as a sandbox, providing some tools on easing your players into sandbox gaming, setting up setting, goals and events to keep them motivated.
Campaigns typically consist of two forms: mission based and sandbox. Mission based campaigns are where the GM sets up a series of tightly defined scenarios (or Adventures) that have a beginning and an end. The missions can be linear: where the players follow clues to take them from one staged event to another (sometimes call railroading) or they can be nonlinear, where the route to the goal is not obvious. In normal RPG parlance, missions are adventures.
A sandbox campaign is an open game where the players and NPCs all have goals and it is up to the players to decide how they meet those goals.
Icar campaigns begin as a series of clearly defined missions and then gradually move to a sandbox. This allows the player team to become accustomed to the setting without making any horrendous mistakes that kill the whole team early on. As the Characters become more mature, you can introduce sandbox elements until the player group is powering the plot. 
The three missions of the Scavenger Setting provided in this book is an example of linear missions that open up into more broad play opportunities. The Scavenger Setting as a whole can be used as an example of using the tools given here.
The Anatomy of a Sandbox
The Icar sandbox is a series of tools for you to use to do the following:
Keep the players motivated and the game moving forward.
Keep track of NPCs and what they are doing.
Understand and plot relationships between NPCs and the group.
Schedule crescendos and set pieces.
The tools used to do this are Themes, Plot Lines, Events and Hooks, Timelines, Relationship Diagrams, Consequences, GM Log, Organising your Game Session and Groups and Personal Goals. Used together, they make your Icar sandbox game. 
The Scavenger Setting included after this Section uses all of these tools and so acts as a full example of these concepts.
Creating a theme
A theme is a over arching concept that binds all of the plots together. A good way to set a theme is to pose a question and then use the plots to answer it. 
Example: Question is �What would happen if the Droids disappeared?�, the plots would then answer that question by including rapid colonisation, investigating the Droids, reclamation of lost colonies and so on.
A sandbox setting can have one or more themes but I recommend that for even an experienced and wily roleplay group a complex theme can be lost in the plots.
Creating a theme is difficult and requires some considerable inspiration. If you are stuck for inspiration then look outside of the Science Fiction genre, find an interesting theme and twist it to fit Icar. 
Example: you might take the theme from the film �Trading Places� with Dan Ackroyd and Eddie Murphy - where rich people are turned into poor people as an experiment. The theme is �What happens when rich people become poor people?�. For here protagonists and plots can easily spring.
Avoid creating themes which buck any of the core premises of Icar. By doing so, various areas of the setting will start to unravel. 
Example Theme questions
What if the planet you were on was entirely controlled by a single benevolent artificial intelligence that was slowly going mad?
How would a team of waster party animals react if they were forced to save the planet they were on?
What would happen if someone made a human into an Automaton by putting controlling implants into their skull? Would anyone be able to tell the difference?
When everything you are told is the truth, how far would you have to go to prove the truths are not lies? Will you have to see the devastation of the Droids for yourself?
How would a slaver operate?
What would it be like living on an Orb where the Artificial Intelligence at its core was allowed to go through Ascension?
What would happen if the Droids actually invaded in a big way?
How would the Imperium deal with a brand new  and widespread uprising?
What would happen if the Droids started evolving past their �Kill Everything� programming? Would they form nations and factions?
Plotlines
A plot line strings together a series of events to make up a story. A newly created plot line assumes that the players never interact with it. You lay out a plot line in the same way you would a normal story. 
Example: If the players were playing the Rebel Fleet in Star Wars: A New Hope, then an Empire Plot Line for the end of the film would look like: Death Star Arrive Yavin 4, Death Star moves orbit to see forest moon, Death Star Blows Up forest moon. In the film, the rebel fleet manage to stop the Death Star blowing up Yavin 4�s forest moon. The plot line, however, is written as if they do not intervene.
Plot can be created like any other story except you can expect the Characters to derail it. You will need a beginning, middle and end. Start by planning the end and work backwards to where the NPCs in the story will start.
Although plotlines are the things you might create at first, they are not used in play as they are but built into the Timeline (see Timelines Section). On a Timeline, all the plots are shown together in a coherent story.
Events and Hooks
An Event is a set-piece of action or scene. Events should be important turning points in the plotline. A Hook is a motivation for the Characters to be at a certain place. Hooks can either be generic for any event or specific to an event. Generic Hooks are more useful because they can generate their own little story line. For the included Scavenger Setting, there are only generic hooks. You might want to create some specific ones that connect the Characters in your group to the event.
Do not assume that the Characters will be at every (or any) event. If they are not then the event should continue as you envisaged. The more Hooks an event has applicable to it, the better the chance that the Characters will be present at it. 
Hooks rely upon the Characters of the game being three dimensional. If the Character is bland then they will have little reason to involve themselves in anything. Not only is that not much fun to play but it will lead the team to railroading as they will be relying on you to provide them with motivation.
Example Event: A demonstration against Tacquent is violently suppressed. 
Generic Hook: The team is invited to a party on Essofin. You might then decide that the party ends up running into the street to join the demonstration.
Specific Hook: A Character has a personal grudge against Tacquent, a Character is chasing a girl and she wants him to go with her, the Characters are offered cash to be body guards for a dignitary at the event.
Avoid making your Events too granular, �A demonstration against Tacquent is violently suppressed� would be about the right level. If you split that into people milling around, a protest march, some speeches and gun fight, you may be putting in a lot of work that you never get to use.
Hooks are your way of steering the campaign into interesting situations. Never force a player team to attend any given event, instead present them with Hooks that are just too good to pass up. If the game seems to stall, throw more hooks in. A single event can have many hooks.
Timelines
Timelines are where you pack together the events of more than one plotline into a single list of events. It is important to put all the events together so that you can see if they make sense as a single coherent story. 
For example, if one event is a planet�s evacuation then a global party scheduled after is unlikely to happen. 
Remember that the plotlines (and therefore the Timeline) will be created in such a way that it is assumed the players never interact with it. It should read like an interesting story by itself. Do not worry about too much detail, especially at the end of a given plotline as the Characters will interact with the NPCs during Events and this will have consequences.
Ensure that hooks occur before the event does so that the Characters have time to finish whatever it is they are doing and attend to the event.
Do not put dates on the Timelines
Every group has a different style of play. Some groups prefer to languish inside long, succulent plots. Other groups prefer a visceral experience. Do not put dates on the Timeline before you play so that you can move events forward (happen earlier) or push them back (happen further into the future). By doing this you can adjust the pace of the game to suit your group. 
To help you keep track of the Timeline, you can put times and dates on the diagram after they have occurred. You can also strike through an event when it has occurred.
Relationship Diagrams
A relationship diagram contains individual NPCs, corporations, syndicates, the player Characters and shows their relationships. Relationship diagrams are useful for tracking who are enemies or allies and for generating events for plots. 
Check out the Scavenger Setting relationship diagram. Each part represents a person or organisation and a line between them shows that there is a relationship. A solid line represents an alliance. A dotted line joins two enemies. Where one person has influence over another, an arrow head is used so that the boss is pointing at the subordinate.
Using Relationship Diagrams
Relationship Diagrams are living diagrams, they will change each time you play as relationships change. To maintain the diagram�s usefulness, redraw it on a regular basis. When ad-libbing NPCs to form the links between two organisations, write the name of the NPC on the link. When you come to redraw the Relationship Diagram, you can form that name into its own box. Relationship Diagrams do not need to be complete knowledge, leave off links that are obvious.
Example: The Machine is a syndicate and therefore is a natural enemy of the Star Enforcers (the police). There is no need to link these as enemies because it�s obvious. If the Star Enforcers are looking for a particular member of the Machine then that NPC can go on, linked to both.
Relationship Diagrams can be used to create Events and Hooks for your plotline. 
Example: If there are sworn enemies on the diagram, what would happen if they were both invited to the same party?
Drawing your own Relationship Diagrams
The first Relationship diagram is always the hardest to draw. Before starting, you should already have at least an outline of a plot.
From the plot, pick the most important organisations and write them on, putting organisation with similar goals (such as Technological or Humanist) near each other. Now link the organisations together. Any organisation you think the player Characters might interact with, add a few NPCs. Start with the names and flesh out as you need. If you are short on names, use the names of well known film and TV stars that fit the look of the NPC.
Do try and keep your diagram as simple as possible as you will need to be able to reference it quickly. Try and keep the text large and if the diagram gets very big, split it into two.
Consequences
Any action or interference should have consequences in Icar. Firefights may injure innocents, some of whom may want to wreak revenge. It is important that the players understand that their actions have repercussions. In a sandbox game, there can be many different plot running concurrently, it can be difficult for the players to understand what the cause of an event might be. If your players are new to sandbox gaming, make the consequences obvious when they happen.
Consequences might be changes to the relationship diagrams or changes in the Timeline. You can also add flavour by adding one-off events later in the Timeline for actions the players have done. An avenging brother of a slain innocent can pop up at the most annoying time!
Sandbox Troubleshooting
Are you having trouble running a sandbox? Things not flowing as well as you hoped? Here are some typical problems with their solutions. 
Players appear bored
Make the Hooks more obvious and provide more of them. Failing that, bring the events closer together.
Players keep missing Events
Make sure the hooks are appearing early enough for them to react. Alternatively, push the Events back.
Players don�t know who to trust so trust no-one
Give the Characters a single NPC confident that they can trust. It might be a member of a Character�s family or someone they have reason to trust.
Players ignore all the events and do their own thing
That is normal. If they are generating their own plots, construct Timelines around them. Put your plots on hold (by pushing back events) until a time when they run out of ways of ignoring the plot.
Organising your Game Session
Running a sandbox game requires more effort up front and more tending during. Furthermore, I am very keen to spend as much time playing the game as possible. As such, I use the following method of organising my time and the players too. You are the GM, they will take their lead from you.
Before the Session
It is important that you have the game fresh in your mind. Re-check relationship diagrams and events on plots and read through the last set of notes you wrote in your log.
The Session - Arrival
Pleasantries are unavoidable. If it is a weeknight, try and get the food prepared beforehand (pizza, curry, etc). Set finish time and schedule breaks.
Seated
Character sheets are handed out and by sitting down to play, it�s important to show that a line has been drawn. Pleasantries over, the business is gaming. I ensure I have a clock somewhere in my sight line - twitching a wrist or craning to see a clock will give over the wrong impression. You�re not bored, after all, you�re just ensuring that the session is progressing.
Recap
One player will recall the last session. Give the player the starting point. Reward the player with up to 3 RP if the recap is in Character and containing all the salient points. If the Character wasn�t present for a lot of the action, then they can still tell the story as if they had heard it from a third person.
Hand RP Out
RP is calculated as RP from play last session + recap + downtime. See Handing out Roleplaying Points on page 109.
RP spend
Players are encouraged to spend their RP quickly. Ask the players to explain to everyone what they have spent their RP on. This is a polite way of getting those that are slow to decide to decide more quickly.
Set scene
Describe where the Characters are and mention emotions. For this first explanation, feel free to lay on the senses thickly. You are setting the ball rolling.
Finish
Always aim to wrap up just before the finish time.
Randomisation - Three dice rule
There are occasions where you need to make a decision on behalf on an NPCs where there isn�t a clear direction to take.    The three dice rule will help you decide whether the NPC is going to help the NPCs, be indifferent or actively be unhelpful.
The three dice rule is helpful because you can roll (cupping) while still talking to the players and then (in mid sentence) glance at the dice to see the colour. As you are only looking for the nearest colour, you can keep talking. Reading off numbers takes the time but spotting colour is very easy.
Group glue and Personal Goals
In a sandbox game it is vital that each of the Characters has a personal goal and the group have a motivation for being together. This should really be inspired by the setting and rest of the group but if a player is having trouble thinking up a goal then ask them to choose from each of these steps. Go through twice. This is intentionally not a random roll system because each item has to be chosen to fit with a certain theme.
Group Glue Examples
Characters are long term friends (but their lives have been unremarkable up to this point).
Characters are family members
Characters are employed by same person (Scavenger Setting)
Characters have just been made redundant from same employer
Characters refugees from same world, invaded by the Droids
Personal Goal Builder
Pick Motivation Against someone else
Revenge / Broken Heart / Family Betrayal
Compensation
Answer to a question
Stolen object
Clash of belief
Irrational hatred
Pick desired outcome (numbers match with list above)
Target dies
Target maimed
Target augmented
Target goes insane
Target impoverished

Scavenger Setting Revisited
The Scavenger Setting is a springboard into Icar that begins with a familiar mission based philosophy and finished as a sandbox campaign where the players are driving the goals of the team.
The Characters are austere, the team begins with only one gun and the Skills are less than generous. You need to stress that the Characters need to work as a team. If a player is keen on playing a sociopath or disruptive Character (which can be fun) then this is not really the right setting.
Prerequisites
Before running this scenario, it is suggested that you have done the following. Although you don�t need to, the terminology will make more sense if you do. There�s a lot of reading to do, but a little effort now will result in a great reward later.
1. Print this document. I would recommend doing a couple of copies of the player section of the Scavenger Setting and give this out to the players to read. This section is not for the players, so keep it secret!
2. Read and understood the rest of this book. It helps if you have a working knowledge of the rules.
5. Print an Arms 5 weapon sheet. For the Security Character class. This can be found in the Equipment Index.
6. Print the Shakespeare Standard Tech Kit. For all the team to gawp at. This can be found in the Equipment Index.
7. Print a Gaia Jack card. For the Human Resources Character and for the Rayengine Technician.
8. Print Orbihaul Sheet. This will be their planetary transport (after the first mission). This can be found in the Equipment Index.
9. Print Character Sheets. There are 3 separate pages required for each Character: The front page (with the Deviant wheel on it), the second page (with Skills and equipment) and a Human / Armour sheet. You�ll need as many sets as you have players.
What�s Here
This GM Section is split in two. The first section contains three missions that will help you introduce Icar, the setting and some mechanics. These missions can be run as shown or used as examples for your own. The second half sets out a sandbox tools introduced in Running an Icar sandbox on page 112. The sandbox includes the theme; extended background; plots; events and example hooks; and even more plot ideas.
The First Few Icar Sessions
Your first few Icar sessions should be light and quick. Even if you intend on running a very dark and brutal campaign, the first sessions should be easy to help the players get used to all the terms and rules. I recommend you order your first few sessions like this:
Before Session 1: Send round the Icar web link www.icar.co.uk and recommend they download and flick through the rules, reading the Scavenger Setting. Do not rely on your players doing this but do give the option.
Session 1: Character creation and the start of Mission 1.
Session 2: Continue Mission 1 and finish it.
Session 3 and 4: Mission 2.
Session 4 and 5: Mission 3.
Session 6 and onwards: sandbox gaming.
Your First Icar Session
Before beginning the delicate first session, it is recommended that the players have read the player section of this document. It also helps if the players have all chosen a Character concept (personality) and Skeleton (job). It may be difficult work out the job just yet as players might want to discuss who does what. Chances are, if left to their own devices, the crew will be made up of Security personnel because they are the skeletons that have the guns. For the first session, I recommend that this is the order of events:
1. Character Creation
Get the Characters out the way as soon as possible. The players should choose a concept (examples given in the players section of this book). The players can then fill in the deviant wheel. Leave the height and weight to last, if in doubt, use the human averages (Height: 6�6�, weight 14st). Place of birth can be found by rolling a D12 and checking the table below.
D12	Place
1,2,3	Corisk
4,5,6	Essofin
7	Kale
8	Dess-Kay-Dar
9	On a spacecraft in The Fleet of House Granger
10	The surface of Obyrworld
11	Outside Anadar - a Dorian Cluster
12	Outside Anadar - a prosperous Sayshell Cluster

2. Money and Kit
Apart from a change of clothing and some personal effects, they have no kit to start with. That which is listed on the sheets are given to them once they have been hired by The Chief (Iss Horn Barnarder). The amount of money they have is:

(Roll a D10 twice, add these two together and multiply the result by ten. The maximum is 200.)
3. Description of Area
Give an overview of the area (an example is given below, read this out if you like), this sets the scene. The Sector of Remmar and the clusters around Darkspace should sound like a clean, hard working place that is trying really hard to get as many of its systems to be recognised and given resources by the Imperium. Anadar should sound like a war zone, grubby, dirty and without trust. The team start on Ominor Orbital around Coriska 3, on the corner of Anadar, they will all have gone there from their home world looking for work. Anadar has many systems that were abandoned during The Droid War. These are not marked as many of them are not deemed safe or there is a lack of facilities at these locations. 
4. Interview
All the Characters have a reason for applying for a job on the Scav vessel. This is included in the Character concept section. What they don�t know is what happened to the last team (see The Last Team on page 118). Also, they will all be immediately employed, because there are no other applicants and that the Botchery Clipper is keen to get away. The ship does not have a very good reputation, but the Characters (or players) are unlikely to know this.
The Captain (Madeline Stuo) and The Chief (Iss Horn Barnarder) will meet them in the shadiest bar on Ominor Orbital, full of shady looking Characters. A fist-fight will break out during the interview, raised voices and drinks spilt. The team might want to get involved but the Chief will ask them not to. The Chief does all the talking, have him ask standard questions about next of kin and odd ones such as �Do you have any religious practises which may lead to decompression?� which may point at problems they�ve had in the past. A list of possible questions is given at the end of this section.
All the Characters should be plied with a lot of kaisa (beer) during the briefing and after that, taken straight to the Botchery Clipper. It�s a bit like press-ganging. The more drunken they are, the better (Meat attribute checks after a couple of beers). The sober ones will be shocked at the state of the Botchery Clipper, the drunken ones will not.
The crew joining fee is 300. None of them will have 300, so take all they have and then say that the remainder will be taken out of their first pay packet. If they complain, say it is standard practise. It�s not but then none of the Characters will know that. They might find out in the future, by which time it will be too late.
5. Medical Inspection
Each crew member should be given a bout of medical, which ends with them being injected with a serum that slows the effects of decompression and purges toxins from the body. A lot of vomiting  and staggering about before they pass out. Dr. Sorex has a terrible bedside manner and will refer to the crew as �Apes�, �Meaties�, �Biologicals� or �The Condemned�.
Have them do their medicals one after the other - so they can see the effects on the previous one. You can even take each player out of the room to explain what happens and them get them to explain to the rest of the team the dreadful reaction. If there are any Brick Shit Houses (a Psychotheatric) amongst the party, they will not feel any of the effects.
6. Transit
When they wake up from their unconsciousness, they will be en-route. There is no holoroom on the Botchery Clipper, so entertainment will need to be found other ways. Iss Horn Barnarder will start training them in flying the Orbihaul, so that they won�t have to use it on the rather poor autopilot.
7. First Mission - The Ungodly Act
The first mission is a typical Scavenger mission and is included later.
Setting Revisited
There is a lot more to the cluster of Anadar than first meets the eye (or that is marked on the map). This section aims to give you, the GM, a detailed look into the workings of Anadar and add systems to the map. All this information can be released, but over time and effort and perhaps by rumour. 
It is written here without bias, the way it is. However, every NPC will have a bias. Do not be afraid to put a spin on the information each time you tell it. The players will soon realise that the oracle of information that is the GM might not be all it is cracked up to be.
The Botchery Clipper
The Botchery Clipper is not all it seems to be. This is split into sections of interest, beginning with the current crew.
Captain Stuo
The Captain is the most unscrupulous woman in known space. She will stop at nothing to get to salvage first and will sacrifice anything to make a profit. She says very little because she believes that the fewer words you use, the more impressive it is. She is cold and heartless. Perhaps, deep down, she does have a fondness for her crew but she buries it so far down no surgeon could ever find it.
Captain Stuo has an alcohol problem but is very adept at covering it up - saying nothing hides her slurred speech. The Chief (Iss Horn Barnarder) knows her secret but thinks it is better kept quiet.
Iss Horn Barnarder
In contrast to the Captain, Iss Horn is a genuinely nice person. He does not counter the Captain because he is scared of her and because of his age, he would not be able to get a job on another ship. He yearns to get back onto the Scavenger Team side of things (going to wrecks) and will try anything to do so. He�s also terrified of retirement and if anyone mentions it, he will get angry.
Captain Stuo will not let The Chief off the spacecraft for long, not only is he a valuable well of knowledge but he also has a huge array of contacts that the Captain often calls upon. The team will often accompany Iss Horn when they visit small colonies around Anadar, Iss Horn is known and liked everywhere.
Dr. Sorex
Dr. Sorex is an extremely old Automaton. The AI is over 500 years old and has been slowly acquiring knowledge. He used to work as an Imperial Midwife but after seeing his 9th baby incinerated for carrying the Genus 2 virus, he began going through ascension.
He can perform just about any function on the ship, but would do so with much complaining and little flair. He will make snide comments about the Captain and about humans (he will call them biologicals) in general. His appalling bedside manner (and lack of respect for his patients) makes him generally unemployable - except by Stuo. He uses Biology as a curse and a cuss. Any words to do with human anatomy, such as flesh, bone, blood and meat can be said with spite.
The Botchery Clipper Structure
The Clipper is made from the parts of other ships. Around the inside of the cargo bay and within access tubes the new team will now and again catch the sight of different paint jobs, even the names of the craft that it was taken from.
The forward bay is sealed up. It will look like a bulkhead and the crew may never notice it. Behind the wall is a Droid Mk3, painted yellow, without ammunition and chained to the floor. It will power up only if the bay is opened - from inside or out (cut in through the hull). Also, the ship has lots of areas where the technology looks a bit Droid-like. This is because it is Droid technology. Of course, the use of Droid technology is illegal and if any Imperium unit was to check it, the ship would be impounded. Captain Stuo keeps the Botchery Clipper looking enough like a wreck that Imperial craft would not pay it a second glance.
Any Zero G technician Character types (who should be familiar with spacecraft) should be given an uneasy feeling about the ship. They will not put their finger on it, as much as they try to search, scan and so on. This is a result of the hints of Droid style technology.
Botchery Clipper Orbihaul (missing)
At the start, The Botchery Clipper does not have an Orbihaul. It is a very notable thing that is missing as without it, there is no way for the crew to get onto a planet surface. The Orbihaul was captured by a rival Scavenger crew before the player Characters join the Botchery Clipper. The first introductory mission (The Ungodly Act) will see the player team returning to the Ungodly Act to get the Orbihaul back.
Dodgy Dealings
By law, any Droid equipment found while scavenging must not be touched but reported over Gaia. This is testimony to dangerous nature. However, Captain Stuo sees the value of this sort of cargo and will trade it as if it was normal scavenged equipment. By doing so, she puts everyone�s lives in danger. There is some Droid cargo is special crates at the back of the main hold. Many of the missions have some sort of Droid element - this is no accident and the team might start to realise the importance of the Droid items to the Captain.
Pay
Is minimal. Regardless of what they scavenge, they will only really get 200 per job. The ship costs will always rise to leave 200 for each member.
The Last Team
The last team were less than profitable, making mistakes and poor judgements about what to take. The team leader, Tom Wright was having an affair with the Captain. He was starting to realise that the Captain was sending them on missions to pick up Droid equipment and he confronted her. While on leave on the Rhot Orb, he took a new girlfriend. 
The Captain took her revenge by sending the team down onto a Orbital wreck in a decaying orbit - where the Scavenger Crew from The Ungodly Act were Scavenging. The Ungodly Act Scavenger crew caused the Botchery Clipper team�s deaths by stealing their Orbihaul when the wreck (Aprose Orbital) was breaking up under gravity. Captain Stuo decided not to attempt a rescue but to leave the system and lay a honey trap.
The Botchery Clipper pretended to be a craft in distress and when the The Ungodly Act approached (with sinister intentions), the Botchery Clipper opened fire, knocking out communications and main power. The Botchery Clipper then left, hoping that by the time they returned, the The Ungodly Act crew would be dead.
There are three crew members left alive on board - one on life support and the other two trying to fix the craft. Sadly, neither of them are technical - one is good with guns and the other is in Human Resources.
The first mission is to return to The Ungodly Act.
Lord E. Tacquent
Tacquent is a 54 year old psychotic. Acute megalomania grips his everyday world and he has decided that he will overthrow the Imperium. He has little patience (he killed his first wife for taking too long getting dressed one morning) and is a shrewd business man. He plans to take over the Remmar Sector by using a secret army of Drorgs (a Borg with some Droid system installed) and a fleet of ships (his Navy, see below) that is almost finished. His 12 children suffer from a similar psychosis and are much more in the public eye. They appear to be doing most of the work for the Tacquent House, but really they are puppets, carrying out orders from their father.
Tacquent is a technophile. He will try to get hold of any piece of technology, no matter how dangerous. His secret police will often be the ones dealing with Stuo�s acquired Droid technology. He sees technology as a method of getting hold of his major goal - Remmar domination.
Tacquent vs Granger
Tacquent hates the Granger family with a seething fury. Accepting the Granger fleet into Essofin would be beneficial, but Tacquent want to see the destruction of the Granger Fleet entirely.
Tacquent is waging a secret war against the Granger family, using a combination of black operation style attacks using the Metropol disguised as pirates and economic power. The war is not working as the size of the Granger Fleet still grows. If the player team do not get involved, then the Tacquent Navy will be brought in to deal with the problem.
Metropol
The Essofin police force is actually the front for his secret army. They are trained in police work, but mainly operate through fear by being heavily armed and acting with a heavy handed approach. There is crime on Essofin but it is organised and protected by the Metropol. The Metropol numbers over 250,000 soldiers, most of which have Borg and Droid technology installed into them. For any police force, the players will soon realise that they are heavily overpowered. Use mid-range bionics to represent their statistics.
Analysts have noticed and reported many times on the fact that the Metropol appears to be a huge force and that the Imperium should sit up and take note.  Tacquent�s spin doctors generic report is that if any expansion to abandoned colonies was attempted then a mobile security force large enough to cope with an influx of people is required. This is a reasonable reason, given that the sceptics do not see the full size of the Metropol.
The Metropol Savants
A section of the Metropol which is somewhere between the secret police and the intelligence gathering corps and number approximately 500. They use Gaia to find information and have a small number of active agents (under 50) that move around any system within Anadar. The Savants are not widely known by the populace and this adds mystery to their operations. Their relationship with the Metropol regular is patchy at best as they use the Metropol for arrests and assassinations without giving reasons or applying law. They are all fiercely loyal and if captured by another system�s council while on an operation are unlikely to give away any information (Hard for Interrogate rolls).
Tacquent�s Navy
The Navy consists of approximately 100 combat cruisers (around the size of a Gaterunner but nowhere near as quick or well equipped), each with a minimum crew of 5 or 6. Tacquent has not invested in any fighter technology as he believes that it is too expensive to operate. This is a poor move and will eventually lead to greater costs both in monetary and human terms. The ships are designed with point to point light jump technology and low power pulse lasers (the ammunition is cheap). The fleet is used to destroy pirates that might threaten Tacquent�s interests and can be used as a taxi service for the ground troops of the Metropol, should they ever be required. 
The Tacquent Fleet is currently spread across Anadar, in little pockets around abandoned systems. This sparsity helps keep the fleet hidden. The players may meet some of these craft while in deep space, perhaps for Stuo to trade Droid parts. Such a well armed fleet is not illegal but its existence might lead the Imperium to look closely at Tacquent�s Droid technology dealings.
The Fleet of House Granger
The Grangers are a powerful force that would like one of the upper reaches of the family to become an Imperial Peer. By trading and building systems with a friendly hands-off approach, they mimic the Imperium�s methodology in hope this will be enough when Darkspace is to get a Imperial Peer. 
House Granger is openly Humanist in philosophy. They distrust any Automaton of intelligence higher than Artificial Intelligence Power 5 (which is the upper limit of most spacecraft). Like most Humanists, they believe that the human race belongs on planets that have breathable atmospheres. They hold great store by these sorts of planets and believe they should be looked after.
Star Civ and the Grangers
The rumours of The Imperium�s involvement in House Granger is true. Two Star Civilisation officers are on board the fleet - one openly using the fleet as a way of charting Anadar. The second officer is quietly grooming members of the Granger family for Imperial Peerage.
Scavengers and the Granger Fleet
The Granger Fleet are openly hostile to Scavengers and often refer to them as carrion as they pick over the bones of civilisations. Also, the Grangers believe that they are little better than pirates. Although this might appear to be a little unfair, it is a fair assessment of many of the Scavenger crews as they skirt the line between legal and illegal operations. The Granger Fleet will trade with trade with Scavenger crews but it is always a tense and unreliable relationship.
Pinacle Trade Group
Not widely known to be owned by the Granger family, the Pinacle Trade Group (PTG) has a lot of power within Anadar. Any system is reliant on the trade vessels that move the product from the planet surface to other systems. This is how most systems make their money. 
The advantage of a Trade Group is that if a spacecraft breaks down or has crew problems, then another craft will pick up the job of moving product from the planet surface. Also, a regular trade routes can create massive discounts in the ferrying of goods. This is how systems like Kale continue to exist. They do not produce a massive amount of goods or anything that is particularly special but they have regular routes set up with the PTG and thus the cost of transportation is greatly reduced. The more ships that are in the group, the more efficient it is - as bulk costs can be spread across all ships. 
The number of vessels in the trade group is a closely guarded secret as the number exceeds 2000! An operation of this size would be more closely inspected by the Imperium, due to the incredible economic power a single company can have over many billions of people, but is yet undiscovered. PTG operates craft of many different sizes, from small and fast Cruisers with couriers on board through to massive Freighters over 2000m in length.
The ability to choose what systems they visit give the PTG incredible power. By denying a small system (with around 90k inhabitants) a regular trade route means that they will find it difficult to compete with those systems of similar size and productivity. This limits growth as people are more likely to set up crofts on those places that have a solid method of transporting goods. The PTG also have a Star Dock of their own in Corisk, but it is held under the corporate name of Hequar Star docks. This allows very cheap repairs and upgrades.
Crews
It�s no secret that the crews within the PTG are very well looked after and the pay is high. Unlike many vessels trading in Anadar, the PTG crews are all paid a monthly salary, rather than based on percentage of profits. Also, the PTG does trips to outside the two clusters, so the wealth of other systems can be shared. This extended Remmar experience is very important when trying to get the best price for some goods. House Granger often use their extensive economic knowledge to aid these decisions and it�s common that a employee of House Granger can be found on smaller vessels as a guide or aid.
How to represent the PTG to the players
The players should see the PTG as these very intelligent and smartly turned out people. The PTG crews will pretty much ignore the player team as Scavenger crews are not regarded with any social standing at all. If pressed, the PTG crews are likely to be snobbish and aloof, only starting fights on occasion. They have the best equipment, the best Skills, the best uniforms and best lifestyle, they do not need to speak to likes of the player team!
The Su Chi
The Su Chi are backing House Granger to become Imperial Peers of dark space. The Su Chi recruit Humanist Extremists from the Pinacle Trade Group and the Granger Fleet and provide black operations for the Grangers as a whole. For more information on the Su Chi, see Su Chi on page 67.
The Machine
The Machine have always had a presence in Anadar and as such have allied with the Metropol as the only other alternative to Fleet Granger. It is an alliance of a common enemy, rather than a joining of ideals. The Machine and House Tacquent make uneasy bedfellows but both benefit from the relationship - for now at least. 
The Machine hope that Essofin might become a home of open rights for Automatons and House Tacquent make use of intelligent Automatons from The Machine for building technology. For more information see The Machine on page 68.
The Technomages
The Technomages are everywhere in Anadar. They have a number of secret installations where they research a variety of illegal technologies - Droid technology being one of them.
The Technomages are most useful to the team as it is a way of getting hold of high technology in return for found Droid technology or rare technical items. The Technomages pay well and make good contacts for the team. Captain Stuo will unwittingly have a few Technomage contacts from selling off illegal Droid technology. For more information see The Technomages on page 65.
Anadar�s Systems
This section includes some additional information on the systems within Anadar. Some of this information can be used as rumour or can be used as description for when the player team visit the system. Not all of the details provided need be used all at once, they can be fed in pieces to the players. It is wise not to change too much on these systems. If you feel creative, then it�s best to create a new system, rather than alter an existing one. This will help consistency in the Timelines. Also, if you do make a change, it�s best to alter the information here (using a footnote in pencil) so that you can remember what the change you made was. The information in italics is what is given earlier and allows you to easily see what the players have already been told.
Anadar�s History
Anadar once teemed with extraordinary colonies. Less famous than other clusters in Remmar, it quietly maintained the very highest standards of art, culture and science. One thousand years ago the Droids flushed out humanity leaving much of the colonies intact. Only those colonies where the inhabitants clung to firmament were destroyed, leaving a patchwork of the remnants of civilisation.
Anadar�s low concentration of star systems and proximity to the centre of the galactic arm meant that many sought refuge there, assuming the Droids would concentrate only on those clusters with high star concentrations. They were wrong. As the Droids swept through, precision attacks disabled spacecraft and killed crews with alarming efficiency.
In 92023, Anadar is a typical Remmar cluster. Some systems are shining beacons of Imperial excellence and others are fledgeling settlements, growing around the edges of the Droid ravaged colonies. The broad areas of void in between contain fleets of disabled spacecraft, abandoned orbitals, deserted colonies and ruins. It is this clutter upon which teams of Scavengers search.
Essofin
Essofin is controlled by a powerful self-proclaimed Lord E. Tacquent it is prosperous but under the tight grip of its Lord. The Metropol (local Police Force) use aggressive force to go about their work and visitors are reminded about the extensive laws on a regular basis. The system does profit from this situation and has reportedly low levels of crime.
Structure
Essofin is a system with 10 planets, of which two have inhabitable atmospheres. It also has a high number of orbitals which provide large raw material output through mining. Although this holds the largest share of the system�s profits (32%), it also has a massive manufacturing capability (holding 29% of the profits). Essofin is a very busy system, it�s principle planet, Sword (Essofin 6) being the most active and the home of Tacquent. A huge number of craft enter and leave the system each hour  (9 to 10 thousand per hour) and thus it is very easy to come and go without being noticed. Essofin has the strongest economy in Anadar as is self-sufficient.
Essofin architecture
The architecture of the planets and orbitals can be described as being dark. As the Mex buildings are made from local materials, the builds are often either gold or onyx in colour. This gives the system an evil and oppressive feeling. Tacquent invests in the style of the Mex buildings and so Essofin is festooned with arches, alcoves, walkways, stained glass windows and monuments.
In Gaia, the depiction of Essofin is precise and there are a huge number of council owned automated Gaia entities that record and report the identification of people and spacecraft. This builds up a huge information store of information regarding people coming and going. If anyone is banned from coming into the system and their ship or Isis is spotted, they will be immediately reported to the Metropol or the Metropol Savants. Of course, these automated systems can be fooled and hidden from (pass in Hacking roll), but they must be anticipated and the roll should be made upon arrival in Essofin. Chances are, players will be caught out the first time and then prepared subsequent times.
Essofin�s Criminal Hulks
Essofin also has a large number of hulks in orbit around the star. These vehicles are mostly unpowered (beyond minor course corrections) and consist of a number of very large freighters that are permanently welded together. In these colonies are the dregs of the system and this is where much of the crime goes on. They are considered private vessels and thus the Metropol may not enter them unless on unofficial business or chasing down a criminal from another place within the system. This makes them an extremely attractive option for player Characters if they get in trouble with Tacquent. 
The most famous (and largest) of these hulks is the Essofin Flyer which is run by a figurehead council and actually run by a Mafia-style crime family. Tacquent would very much like to be rid of this family but they are a �known evil� and thus can be watched, at the very least. If contact is made with them, they may appear to be in league with Tacquent, but this is just for appearances and if the players get �in� with the Essofin Flyer Mafia, then they will soon learn that this is far from the case!
Kale
Essentially a humanist system, Kale amounts to very little with only a small amount of agriculture and little or no trade produce. Hippy-like values and a communist view of possession makes this system unable to compete in the difficult trade market in Remmar as a whole. 
Their ideals hark back to pre-Codex Akarakian beliefs - that toil should be both mind and body in equal measure. Kale inhabitants take this a step further and believe that mind and soul are interlocked and so philosophical reflection is equally important.
Structure
Kale is a system with only one inhabited planet, Liberty (Kale 3). Liberty is populated with 90% humanists that are trying the best to get �back to basics�. To then, this means farming with as little mechanical aid as possible. For some, this means an automated harvester, for others, they like to eke out their existence with ploughs made from sustainable forests. It�s a simple life but the population is happy for it. 
The other 10% are those people that realise that for this dream planet to work, some people will have to interact and work with the rest of the cluster and they live in the only, small Mex city: Rhea. This includes the council, star port support staff and Hauler crews. These people like Kale for the quietness and relaxed attitude to trade. People are honest and well meaning. Although the architecture is simple (very typical Mex construction, with very little embellishment), it is functional and that is the system to a tee.
House Granger�s Influence
The one strong factor of Kale is that it has a contract with the Pinacle Trade Group and is often visited by the Fleet of House Granger. This allows the cheap transportation of the food off planet. The reason for this is that House Granger are keen to take control of Kale and they see this as the best way of doing so. Pinacle are not the only trade group running to the planet, but they hold the largest share. It could be argued that without this, Kale would not be listed as an established system.
House Tacquent�s Machinations
The House of Tacquent would also like to get their hands on the system of Kale. This is definitely a desire of Tacquent as he sees the resources that Kale has to offer as a good reason to take over. Also, he finds the under utilisation of the food output under the small croft on Liberty as ridiculous. His plans for domination include Kale and he has begun by offering the council security and resource aid in return for their allegiance. Of course, no-one attacks Kale (there�s nothing to steal!) and the Pinacle Trade Group contract allows the system a fair amount of economic security so they refuse and keep their independence and ideals.
Pri-Sot (The Hidden System)
Little is known about Pri-Sot except that it is very difficult to locate. Situated in a volumetric gap within a large nebula, Pri-Sot keeps is anonymity. It is believed that it is a hideout for criminals and pirates, the nebula providing an excellent hiding place.
Pirates and Outcasts
Pri-Sot is a system whose legend is far more impressive that it�s reality. A single, scorched planet (Imbroglio) orbits a red dwarf star. Imbroglio has a corrosive atmosphere and most of the population of this system is either under the surface of the planet, in the massive mining colony of Brogg, or in one of Pri-Sot�s 6 orbitals! Primarily, Pri-Sot is the home of political outcasts from elsewhere and those who are hiding from the long arm of the Imperium, without the dangers of the lone systems to contend with. This includes a large number of space-faring folk (pirates) and it does cater for them with excellent technological and 0g star docks.
Pri-Sot is completely self-sufficient because any regular trade route would make it too easy to locate. Food is produced in massive underground hydroponic landscapes and it can feed more than the population requires. The council of Pri-Sot is surprisingly well run, the sometimes overly violent police force enforcing a cut-down version of Imperial law. Pri-Sot does have the death penalty.
Pri-Sot (not) on Gaia
On Gaia, Pri-Sot is a tour de-force. Normally, spacecraft use Gaia to locate a system when planning a light jump across space. However, Pri-Sot uses a huge number of Entities to confuse the Gaia presence. This can not be hacked and plays upon the very nature of Gaia. You can not access Pri-Sot Gaia information from outside the system but you can access elsewhere from Pri-Sot. When someone talks to a person in another system from Pri-Sot, the location is given as �Unknown - Dead Space?�. This is highly desirable for the sorts of people who are there. The largest issue with this system is that most security system will not allow someone of this location near their establishments, thus hackers often operate from their own spacecraft - giving them a location.
Finding Pri-Sot
The only ways to find Pri-Sot is either an extensive search of the nebula (takes 10 days) or by being given relative time and space co-ordinates. This means that it is a location at a certain time. Due to the space-time properties of the nebula, a pure location is not enough to locate the system. Thus, if the player team are told where Pri-Sot is, this information will only be good for an hour, if they go too early or too late, they will not find the system. There is no method of working out where the system is, given a number of previous locations and times. The system itself does not move, just the space and time around it.
Rhot Orb
As the tales suggest, Rhot Orb is packed with hidden treasure. Treasure that predates the Droid invasion is in works of art and other antique valuables that fetch a high price with the art dealers and wealthy of Sayshell. Since the Droid invasion pirates have used it as an ideal place to hide just about anything from whole spacecraft to valuable minerals. 
Like all Orbs, Rhot Orb is huge. So large that treasure hunters searching without the co-ordinates of known treasure are unlikely to find anything at all.
The Jungle
The inner sphere of Rhot Orb was once a beautifully manicured world with every geological feature you can imagine - fields, savanna, mountains, lakes, rivers and a huge ocean. However, jungle and swamps have taken over, even climbing up the taller mountains. The exclusive villas have been consumed by the plant life and although the insides of the buildings remain intact, they are very difficult to find.
Treasure Hunters
The people who live inside the Orb refer to themselves as treasure hunters and there are families who stretch back many generations living in nomadic groups within the skin. Once in a generation, a family will happen upon a truly huge find of treasure, which they must protect until it can be sold to a steady stream of traders. Most of the hunters are friendly to outsiders but less so to other hunter families. If the players own a spacecraft then the treasure hunters will be their best friend.
Dess-Kay-Dar
Dess-Kay-Dar is a mining system whose council rarely lasts longer than a few months at a time. A large number of rich and mining companies own the gas and mineral mining operations throughout the system and all attempt to place a puppet government in power that will be of benefit to them. 
Each of the mining companies have their own security force, which they use to protect their interests. The employees of these live and breathe the mines where they work and as such are fanatical about their companies. Their pride and interest in politics is universal in Dess-Kay-Dar and this is what fuels the rioting. The upshot is that no single mining company gets the upper hand - even when they local a seam of rich mineral.
Dess-Kay-Dar is a good place to sell any kind of technological salvage and the mining companies do offer work to scavenger vessels for finding very particular technical goods.
Franesk (not marked)
A system so small it is not listed on the Anadar Star Map, Franesk has been quietly funded by the Granger Fleet for over a year. The population level has not reached a point where it is listed in any of the system guides held at the Star Civilisation offices on Coriska. Inclusion into these guides is normally achieved by request and application or by a Star Civilisation agent visiting the system. Franesk will suddenly become noticed and should �appear� on the star map (draw it on). The system is a thriving place and will have a massive population that will be rapidly be increasing. When you are ready to bring it into the fore, here is a description:
Although a new system, Franesk has a very strong economy. With the assistance of the Granger Fleet, this agricultural colony also has an artistic side and is producing excellently designed buildings, vehicles and Gaia objects. Franesk has also established several Pinacle Trade Group trade routes, allowing it to undercut most of the systems in Anadar for food produce.
Tao
Tao is purely supported by a Pinacle Trade Group contract, Tao has a number of small industries that give it a diverse culture. The main colony is an inhabitable planet, the surface covered in rich oceans teeming with life. Erratic and often violent weather prohibits wide scale farming but the farmers have adapted and manage to turn a surplus for trade. 
Tao has a small Orbital whose main outputs are mining, luxury goods and technology. A small, automated manufacturing operation produces goods mostly for trade. 
The populace of Tao may seem a little vague, but are essentially a hardy people. Not scared of the most severe conditions, they doggedly work to improve and expand their colony.
Tao is the most uncomplicated system in Darkspace. It has a small number of people doing some very specialist tasks and that is pretty much it. 
Machinations
Tao is a favourite stop for the Granger Fleet as they are a one-stop location for lots of the things that the Fleet needs: food, water, raw materials and technology.
Tacquent�s family are keen on Tao because of the opportunity it presents and Tacquent himself wants Tao purely to reduce the number of place where the Granger Fleet are welcome.
Campaign Sandbox
Relationship Diagram
The Relationship Diagram shows the main relationships between the key players in Anadar. On the left of the diagram is Tacquent and his link with the criminal Syndicate The Machine through the Metropol (and the Savants). In the middle is the Botchery Clipper, where Captain Stuo is working with the Metropol (see Introductory Mission 2, the Lethal Rings of Obyrworld). The Botchery Clipper is a natural enemy of the Granger Fleet. On the right hand side of the diagram are the Humanist elements of the campaign - which is centred on the Granger Fleet. They control the Pinacle Trade Group, who often deal with the Su Chi criminal syndicate.
Timeline
The example Timeline has three plotlines: Tacquent, Granger and �Other�, which includes the Imperium plots and the Syndicates.
The Timeline as a whole tells a story of a tussle between Tacquent and the Granger Fleet, culminating in an all out Fleet vs Fleet war at the end. The Su Chi are always allied with the Granger Fleet and the Machine start being allied to Tacquent. This does not last and a secret war rages on Essofin and Kale. Although controlled (and funded) by The Granger Fleet, the Pinacle Trade Group acts in a business-like manner.
In this campaign, Tacquent makes up the obvious villain and the Grangers are represented as a sinister group. Their motivations are the same as Tacquent�s - to become Imperial Peers but their methods are less violent.
Players vs Who?
The most obvious route for a Gamesmaster to take is to make Tacquent the obvious enemy and then either ally with the Grangers or attack Tacquent alone. If you have a player group new to sandbox gaming, this is the obvious route.
If your players are a little more feisty, you may want to have them ally with Tacquent and fight back against the Grangers. The Imperial influence, although benevolent, can be made to appear malignant. The Grangers are humanist and that means that they do not treat technology and Automatons with proper respect. If the players have gained a soft spot for Dr Sorex after the 100th time he has glued them back together, that might be a good way to spin against them.
Control of Systems
Being �in control� of a system means nothing if you cannot support it with trade spacecraft. Every colony is lacking in something and it is trade vessels that bring it. This is where the balance between Tacquent, who can gain control of a colony�s council and the Granger Fleet (and thus Pinacle Trade Group) who control how they sell.
Hooks
Below is a list of generic hooks, any of which can be used to put the Characters in the right place at the right time.
Invited to a party
Hired by Granger fleet as Mercenaries to disrupt Tacquent operations.
Hired by Tacquent to infiltrate Granger fleet.
Transport Droid cargo from Essofin to Rhot Orb.
Rhot Orb treasure hunters contact Characters to arrange transport of goods.
Tacquent family member charters Character�s craft for some tourism.
Crew on a disabled pirate craft need passage to Pri-Sot. One of the pirates knows how to get there.
The Great Anadar Fayre on Corisk. 4 days long, 10 square miles of festival, music, dancing, art, markets, bars, deals done and people disappear. Everyone will be there. Each colony sets up a large �tent� representing their history and customs.
Characters offered a charter from a Borg that wants to go to Obyrworld. The Borg has Droid technology installed and goes mad en route.
One of the Characters sleeps with a high ranking member of the Tacquent Family. Being inbred and insane, she/he becomes obsessed by the player Character. This person becomes either ally or enemy.
A Dess-Kay-Dar corporation trying to gain power on Dess-Kay-Dar contact team to turn a scheduled peaceful demonstration into a riot.
The Machine (Syndicate) need to evacuate ten Automatons who have started ascension on Tao before they are destroyed. The Automatons will need to be stolen and carried somewhere safe.
Su Chi (Syndicate) are gathering on Essofin and need safe passage for some of their operatives. Once on Essofin, the team may get embroiled in a number of terrorist actions against House Tacquent.
Technomages are looking for lost technology in the Rings of Obyrworld, they can scan for it. The team find out it is a powerful light jump engine. If persuaded, the Technomages will allow them to have it as long as a Technomage can study it working.
During an attempted mugging, the team find a stolen wallet on one of the muggers. It contains a data card with co-ordinates of valuables on the Rhot Orb.
Insane Tacquent Family member requires a charter to take him on a killing spree on another system. He and some bodyguards will talk openly about the fact that they are going to hunt some humans on whatever colony they�re going to.
Introductory Missions
To help run your first Icar campaign, three missions are included below. They have been created to demonstrate a feel for Icar, rather than setting out canon. Feel free to use the missions as they appear or modify to suit your group.
In each mission description, you will find example text that can be read out to the players. These example nuggets act as examples of the kinds of information that is told to the players before they have the chance to ask questions. The person likely to be saying the text is given at the start, for example:
Rob Lang: Example spoken text looks like this.
Each mission is split into Scenes. These scenes are to help you understand how the missions are put together and do not need to be told to the players.
Mission Outlines
Mission One, �The Ungodly Act� is designed to introduce your players to Icar gently with some exploration, tension and a firefight at the end. The rules used for this mission are Skill checks and Fire Fighting combat.
Mission Two, �The Lethal Rings of Obyrworld� begins with negotiations with undercover Tacquent Metropol on Obyrworld that go sour causing a close combat fight. The player Characters then acquire the location of some valuable salvage in the Rings, wherein they fight a damaged Droid. This mission uses close combat and vehicle combat.
Mission Three, �Porcupine� is where the Botchery Clipper answers a distress call to find two craft disabled. One is a Granger Fleet craft and the other is a pirate. The Granger Craft needs salvaging before the pirate craft is repaired. Leaving in the nick of time, they are then chased away by the pirates. This mission focuses on space combat and Gaia Hacking.
Mission One: The Ungodly Act 
In this mission, the team will enter their first floating wreck, survive nonlethal booby traps and finally fight for their lives against two survivors. The aim is to introduce your players to Icar�s fire fighting combat system (which is the easiest and most commonly used combat system) and for them to survive, having had a tense exploration. The aim is not total party kill!
Scene 1: En route.
Captain Stuo: We are en-route to a wreck we spotted coming back from our last salvage. It could not be hailed and from sensor readings we believe it to be adrift. We approaching to perform a medium range scan. Please feel free to relax until we have done that but no alcohol or recreational drugs.
The Ungodly Act was lured into a honey trap by The Botchery Clipper and was attacked, knocking out its light jump engines and communications systems. It also killed 8 of the 11 crew, critically injuring 1. The two crew members alive are the Human Resources (Abigail - a pretty, petit, blonde woman in her 20s, terrified and made paranoid by stress) and Security (Mary - a tall, athletic woman in her 40s with shocking white hair and a scar that runs from eye to navel). 
The injured crew member is in a suspension tube - filled with aqueous goo and kept alive on life support. This was the craft�s first officer, Barry. Both Abigail and Mary know they were attacked by the Botchery Clipper and assume that anyone coming back onto The Ungodly Act are coming to kill them.
All three are hold up in the Orbihaul that they stole from the Botchery Clipper. The Orbihaul is in the cargo bay at the back of the craft. Life support is dead and air is toxic as a result. There is very little dust, which suggests that it�s only been off for a couple of weeks. There are no dead bodies as the three crew incinerated the bodies.
Scene 2: Medium Range
Captain Stuo: We believe it is the cruiser �The Ungodly Act�, a registered Scavenger Vessel that was last heard of 20 days ago. This Salvage is likely to have excellent cargo prospects. Life support is damaged, as are the engines. There is no reply over Gaia, so any Gaia communications must be damaged. There might be booby traps, so be wary.
Scene 3: Approach
The team are to enter the craft at the bridge airlock.
There is no power at the airlock, anyone with Spacecraft Systems Skill make a check to open it manually (and without setting off alarms).
If fails or Spacecraft Systems then Mechasys Systems Skill check to cut using an energy cutter. This will be messy (even messier if they fail).
NB: Don�t booby trap the airlock, it will make the players too jumpy. Furthermore, the NPCs left of the craft do not have the technical knowledge to rig booby traps outside.
Scene 4: Explore the craft
The Ungodly Act has an ostentatious interior design. The pewter metal walls are dulled to show off etchings of mysterious planets that glow as you pass. Every corner is decorated with a classical column topped with scrolls. The ceiling of even the most mundane corridors will have intricate vaulting that is delicately lit. It gives off the feeling of an opulent space cruise liner, possibly because the interior was ripped from the wreck of a cruise liner. Mood lighting will still be on because each floating orb that produces it will have its own generator.
General Description
The team can then explore the craft, looking for personal affects worth credits as well as cargo. Personal affects are always first. 
Booby Traps!
Throughout the craft will be a series of small booby traps aimed to maim the team and let the two surviving crew members know that someone else is on board. Booby traps should do stun only - this is only the first game! You can fling Characters across rooms and down corridors but Stun should be the only damage they take.
The Bridge
The power on the bridge is out. Any Tech Character can bring it back to life. The hard light bridge controls will be haphazardly redirected to �somewhere in the cargo bay�. Controls to the spacecraft are actually redirected to the Orbihaul in the cargo bay. Skill checks Gaia Hacking or Spacecraft systems to find this out. Not all of the items have been redirected: sensors and Communications have not. Communications is damaged but sensors were not moved because the two remaining crew members are not technically proficient enough to realise.
Living Quarters
There are lots of valuable personal affects in the living quarters. A Human Resources Character should roll Style for each room they are investigating. The Captain�s room will need to be cut into as the door is jammed shut (from damage).
Galley
The galley is strewn with discarded plates and cutlery. The Bioreorganiser (which is used to make food) unlocked and empty, suggesting someone has had the biomatter (from which food is made) out of it.
Suit Room
The suit room (where the team gets ready to go to a wreck) is depressurised and the door will not open unless forced. If opened, then more bulkheads will automatically close to stop air leaking out. This is where the scavenger team were when the Botchery Clipper attacked.
Cargo Bay
The Cargo bay is a huge cavern with space crates grouped together on the walls and ceiling. The Orbihaul is in the middle on one side by the airlock. There is no artificial gravity in the cargo bay (Grav Field Generator is turned off - which can be turned back on using Hacking or Spacecraft Systems). The doors are welded shut from the inside. The Characters can cut their way in (Mechasys Systems). The air in the cargo bay is still breathable (being so much of it, it takes longer to be used up).
Scene 5: Ambush!
When the players entered the Ungodly Act, the remaining two crew members were alerted to them. When they finally cut their way into the cargo bay, Mary will open fire (see stat Box). The first burst should fail as Mary scrambles for a better vantage point.
Scene 6: The Orbihaul
The Orbihaul is a pewter gun metal colour, any identifying insignia have been scratched out. Unlike the rest of the Ungodly Act, the Orbihaul has not been treated well. This is because it�s the stolen Orbihaul from the Botchery Clipper. The main cargo bay of the Orbihaul has power, gravity and life support functioning. Biomatter cartridges from Bioreorganisers across the ship are piled in one corner and in another corner is the suspension tube where the First Officer is on life support.
Abigail is hiding in the cockpit of the Orbihaul, she is terrified and will come out shooting when the team enter. Abigail will not be reasoned with, she is in a state of panic and will just fight.
Scene 7: Wrapping up
Once Abigail and Mary are dealt with, the crew will gather salvage. If unsure what to do, they can contact Iss Horn Barnarder. Iss Horn will tell them to load the Orbihaul, he will consult the Captain. The team can distribute the weapons between them. They will need them for the next mission. Iss Horn will wait until the team have filled the Orbihaul before reporting back.
Iss Horn: The Cap�n says to leave the First Officer on board the Ungodly Act.
Take the Security Member of the team aside.
Iss Horn: The Cap�n wants you to put a bullet in her head to make sure.
Whatever happens, the Captain will not allow the First Officer on board.
Mission Two: The Lethal Rings of Obyrworld
Mission two is in two parts. It mission begins with the team negotiating with poorly disguised Metropol. The Metropol aren�t friendly at all and a fight breaks out. As the fight starts to look like it will be going the player�s way, the lead Metropol negotiator will escape in a car, leading to a car chase. Once they catch the Metropol negotiator, he will release information about the valuable wreck in the rings. The second part of the mission will be the investigation of a wreck called the Toast Rack in amongst the Rings of Obyrworld. The Toast Rack is a Metropol trap and contains a heavily damaged Droid. 
The mission will give the players a chance to have a fist fight using the Close Combat rules and a vehicle-to-vehicle dog fight using the Vehicle Combat rules. The second half points out how lethal even a damaged Droid actually is.
Scene 1: En route to Obyrworld
Captain Stuo: We are going to call in a debt with some information brokers on Obyrworld. Over the past two years, we have been dealing with Obyrworld Information Brokers to supply us with details of profitable wrecks in the Rings. In return, we have been fetching them crates from abandoned stores across the cluster. The last two trips we did on the proviso that they were on the brink of discovering a valuable wreck known as The Toast Rack in the Rings. They now know the location of the wreck and want to discuss matters face to face. 
Go down to Obyrworld�s star port, Amo. Meet the information brokers in The Ancient Mariner and pick up the co-ordinates. They might want to counter offer. Do no accept it. You are not there to bargain, you are there to pick up The Toast Rack�s co-ordinates. Make sure you land the Orbihaul far from the port and use the Botchery Clipper�s Kestrel to go to and from it. Orbihauls are far too valuable to Obyrworld�s inhabitants as they are the key to getting to the Rings.
Scene 2. Into Amo and the The Ancient Mariner
The sandy sprawling port of Amo is a muddled mix of Croft buildings, an unfinished Mex City complex and a shanty town of spacecraft carcasses and space crates converted into make-shift houses. For all of its rough edges, Amo has a vibrant culture, driven by riches served down from the scavenged remains in the Rings. Those getting rich from trading scavenged goods are known as Brokers and they are both business and criminal organisation. As such, most of the inhabitants either are or aspire to be connected in some way to a Broker.
People in Amo can be group easily between those that spend a lot of time in the rings - who are pale and well dressed and those that live only on Obyrworld, who are tanned and scruffy. The darker your skin, the less time you�ve spent in the Rings. A pale pallor is seen as a badge to be proud of.
The Ancient Mariner
Situated in the very hub on Amo is a bar called The Ancient Mariner. Frequented by Scavengers and Brokers, it is where business transactions are proposed, shouted, wrestled and set on fire. The Ancient Mariner has a no guns policy, enforced by an 8ft tall Borg called Williamson. He will stay out of fights that don�t involve guns but when a gun is drawn, he will tangle with whomever gets in his way. Any damage that you do to the Ancient Mariner needs to be paid for. If you refuse then debt collection will be handed over to the Brokers and Amo will become a no-go zone.
GM: A huge Borg 8 feet tall welcomes you to The Ancient Mariner with a nod. You indicates a sign to one side of the door above some lockers that says �Customers are politely requested to bring No weapons into the bar�. The bar has a vaulted ceiling filled with hanging examples of �treasure� found in the rings. Each piece looks like a time capsule from a time 1000 years ago when the Droids first struck: adverts from long defunct companies, memorabilia from dead sports stars and trinkets that were once prized. 
The layout of the bar is entirely secluded booths, each with its own sound field generator that ensures privacy. Between the booths where rickety Automatons shuffle plays a laid back jazz. An Automaton shows you to your table, Adam Harrod has been expecting you./
Scene 3. The Negotiation with fists
Captain Adam Harrod is a Metropol spacecraft Captain who has been hiding in the Obyrworld rings for nearly a year. A cruel, violent, bloodthirsty man, he is tired of the waiting game that Tacquent has commanded him. He wants action and is a tinderbox waiting to ignite. His battle ready Cruiser The Void Cutter is hidden inside a particularly large chunk of debris. Adam has been posing as an information broker to obtain Metropol supplies that have been hidden around the Cluster that the Botchery Clipper (and other spacecraft) have been collecting for him. As the Brokers rarely leave Obyrworld and certainly have no interest in the Metropol, he has them all fooled. 
Adam Harrod is bald, 70 (35 in 21st Century years), with thick tattoos instead of eyebrows. He speaks slowly, with a growl to his voice. He won�t give over the Toast Rack details to the team without more  work because he is a bored megalomaniac and wants to feel important while remaining low key.
Even the slightest provocation will start a fight between the players and him. Any provocation and he throw his drink, turn over the table or yell abuse. Other bar regulars might side with him when the fight starts. Use the bar regulars to pad out the fight if you have a lot of players.
If the fight goes badly
If you find that the players are losing (due to poor luck), you can have one of Adam�s Henchmen draw a gun. Williamson, the security Borg, will step in and disarm him, knock him out and throw him onto the street. Other bar fighters might see this and decide to give up.

Scene 4: The chase
Adam will escape out the front of the bar (his ) before he runs out of Stun. He drives a poorly disguised Metropol van. Only those Characters that have a background on  Essofin have a chance of noticing that (Wit roll with -2 difficulty). He is escaping to a shuttle hidden in a gully 6 miles out of town.
The Metropol van has a door-mounted gun but it needs someone to fire it and Adam will be on his own. Instead, he will be firing a Havan 11 from a hole in the windshield. As Harrod has the Psychotheatric Spatially Aware, he can fire his weapon from his moving van while firing at another moving car (the player Characters) without attracting the �target moving� modifier. He will keep trying to fight the players - even though his van is faster than the player�s Kestrel. Running would only show where his shuttle is located.
If the players are finding it difficult to shoot down the Metropol van (because they have left their weapons at the weapons check) then you can suggest that boarding the Metropol van is possible (and nonlethal). They need to win advantage, and board the van instead of shooting. If the players can think up another way then let them do it when they gain the Advantage. More information on Dog Fighting can be found on page 17.
At the end of the chase, the players should have a plastic data card that will have co-ordinates of the Toast Rack in the rings. If you have a Character with Hacking, then say they need to hack the card to get the information off. If they search the van then they will find some Arm 5 rifles with ammunition and LVGs.
Scene 5: Into the Rings
GM: The Rings of Obyrworld consist the debris of three huge Orb space stations that were destroyed by the inhabitants when the system was about to fall to the Droids. The rings teem with valuable debris and even complete spacecraft. Most of the debris is more than 1000 years old, dating from when the Droids attacked. Iss Horn tells you to get suited up.
The Toast Rack is a model of spacecraft only 150 years old - which is considered to be new in Icar. Consider the Rings of Obyrworld as an asteroid field where the asteroids are remnants of human engineering. As such, the Toast Rack has taken a lot of surface damage (shields will protect most craft without a problem but the Toast Rack has shields down) and looks battered and old. Any Zero G technicians should do a Spacecraft know Skill check. A pass will show that the Toast Rack is new, a pass by more than 40 should reward them with more information from below.
The Toast Rack
The Toast Rack was a spacecraft stolen from the House Granger Fleet by Metropol Savants. The Savants took the Toast Rack (with the families and crew on board) to the Rings of Obyrworld and dropped a damaged Mk 1 Droid (humanoid skeleton) into the craft. The Droid killed everyone on board. The Savants then wanted to move the Toast Rack into the path of the Granger Fleet - hoping they would take it onto one of the huge Granger hulk Star Docs, where the Droid could wreak havoc. In a large fight that destroyed much of the internal systems, the Droid took out the Savants too. Since then, the Savants have treated the craft as a place to send people they want to double cross and not come back.
The Toast Rack has no power, no atmosphere and no gravity.
Scene 6: Onto the Toast Rack
The Toast Rack should be seen as a typical mission. The inside of the toast rack are strewn with bodies of two kinds. The majority are scavengers in Moss EV suits, sent there by Metropol Savants to �disappear�. There will also be the bodies of families, frozen in time. The Droid will wait a few minutes to appraise the newcomers before attacking. The Droid does not have any weapons but does blunt damage in close combat. The Droid will use hit-and-run guerilla tactics.
The craft has been stripped of any worthy salvage but there are personal items the dead scavengers and families. This is a perfect time to give the Security member a weapon upgrade to an Astraripper 2E (or similar). You can limit its effectiveness by providing only 100 rounds of ammunition.
Mission Three: Porcupine
This mission is in two parts and should be completed in one play session at considerable speed. The first part is the arrival at a fresh wreck that has to be stripped at speed. The second part is escape from the wreck and space combat. By the end of this combat, you have the option of killing Iss Horn Barnarder and Captain Stuo and giving the team the Botchery Clipper as their own first spacecraft.
Scene 1: En Route
Captain Stuo: We have received a distress call from a craft just one hour away. They are being attacked by pirates and are losing spacecraft systems hand over foot. Either we will be early enough to help or late enough to salvage. Either way, we�re going in. Suit up and arm up.
Scene 2: Approach
Captain Stuo: We have finished our Light Jump and there are two craft here. One (called the Porcupine) is completely disabled, we believe that it was the one putting out the distress call. There is also an armed pirate vessel (called The Unbroken Arrow), which is also heavily damaged. I can see crews on the outside of the pirate vessel performing repairs, so we may have limited time. The plan is to pick up cargo of any worth and leave before the pirates are repaired. While you�re on board see if you can ascertain the origin of the craft. Time is short, so suit up./
Iss Horn Barnarder will be in the suiting room for this mission, helping everyone get ready. He will be generating a lot of nervous energy. It is notable because it is the first time that anyone would have seen Iss Horn nervous. Rather than use the Orbihaul, the Botchery Clipper will dock onto the side of the Porcupine.
Scene 3: The Porcupine
The Porcupine is a very well looked after Granger Fleet spacecraft, a medium sized freighter (larger than the Botchery Clipper), its job was part habitation and part cargo. More than 500 people lived on board. Everyone is now dead, through depressurisation and life support failure. The salvage here will be for expensive personal items, trinkets, jewellery and other items that can be carried off easily. Iss Horn will advise them to get into the living quarters, which will be filled with floating corpses, and search for expensive items. As the Porcupine is a modern craft, all the Characters will be able to spot expensive items. The Captain�s quarters has a safe that includes the documents for the craft and a card with 110 000 credits on it. 
During the search of the Porcupine, the team will be hurried by Iss Horn, who will be watching the repairs on the Pirate craft very carefully. The Botchery Clipper will be docked onto the Porcupine in such a way that the Pirate craft cannot get a lock on.
Scene 4: Back to the Botch
The first set of systems that the Pirate craft will get back online will be its pulse laser. The Pirate will start opening fire on the Porcupine, attempting to kill off the Scavenger team. Inside of the Porcupine, there will be flying debris, energy shock waves and plenty of gas clouds caused by base metals turning to steam. This translates to the player Characters being thrown around, picking up a lot of stun and needing to help each other get off the pirate craft. After 20 turns of firing, the Porcupine will start to break up and the Botchery Clipper will need to undock and move clear.
Note that the Porcupine is entirely silent as it breaks up. Only when debris or shock waves hit the Character will there be any sound. As communications are Gaia based, they will not be affected by any energy shock waves.
Scene 5: Escape!
Once onto the Botchery Clipper, the technical people will be ordered to the Engineering bay and everyone else will need to go to the bridge. Space Combat will then begin. The Captain will make the decisions on what needs to be done at each step. At first, the aim will be to disable the Pirate Craft and then escape. If this does not work out then the Captain will just escape. At no time will the Captain entertain the option of boarding The Unbroken Arrow. If badgered by the players to attack, Captain Stuo will say:
Captain Stuo: Never judge the crew by the craft
Make sure that during Space Combat everyone is kept busy.
The Unbroken Arrow
The Unbroken Arrow is a typical pirate craft that bristles with guns and speed but lacks defence and cargo capacity. The Unbroken Arrow was damaged heavily in its fight with the Porcupine and although the crew have worked hard to get it back online, it is a shadow of its former power. As such, it is now slightly weaker than the Botchery Clipper. The Broken Arrow will give chase for a few turns but will eventually give up when they realise that the Botcher Clipper has excellent shielding.
(Optional) Scene 6: Interloper
One of pirates from The Unbroken Arrow were hiding on The Porcupine when the Botchery Clipper docked. As the team searched the Porcupine, the pirate crept onto the Botchery Clipper and hid. After they escape, he will break onto the bridge and kill the Captain and Iss Horn Barnarder in a suicide run. As the team should be in their EV suits still, they should be protected. The attacker only needs a pistol to kill them both.
Mission Ideas
If at the end of the 3 missions, your team are still finding their feet, then I can recommend using the Botchery Clipper under the command of Captain Stuo a little more. Either way, these are ideas for further missions. This missions, although touching on the main campaign elements in the setting are not events in the campaign itself and are therefore good precursor missions.
Return to Obyrworld
The team were double crossed by Adam Harrod, return to Obyrworld to demand compensation. This would lead to making Tacquent an enemy, which would in turn create plenty of plot hooks.
The Astro Graveyard
The Graveyard is located on the edge of a nebula and contains thousands of wrecks. As the Droids were sweeping through the cluster, many craft banded together and hid, hoping to be ignored. This fleet consisted largely of unarmed refugee craft. Now, they float on the edge of a spectacular nebula. The self-proclaimed owners of the salvage will not like others picking off choice spacecraft without their permission (and tribute). There is nothing illegal about the player Characters scavenging in the Fleet but the owners might disagree.
Botchery Clipper�s Lower Bay
The lower bay on the Botchery Clipper contains a damaged Droid Mk 3. Some damage to the Botchery Clipper has allowed it to become unleashed and has finally worked its way through into the main cargo bay. It must be destroyed.
Carl Tacquent�s Gambit
Lesser family member Carl Tacquent is trying to get a name for himself. He challenges Scavenger Teams to bring back a statue created by Bellerwick. There are four statues in Anadar and he gives the location of one on Obyrworld. The reward is 2 million for the first team to return one intact. The statues are 100m tall and made out of granite. 
The teams can either go to Obyrworld and fight for that one or use the Undergaia/Gaia Research to find another nearby. Then there is the problem of moving it safely into orbit. Captain Stuo will use the money on improving the Botchery Clipper and equipment for the team. The subsidiary aim for this mission is for the team to meet other Scavenger teams and deal with them either with respect-among-thieves or a fight.
