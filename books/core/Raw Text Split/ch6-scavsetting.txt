Scavenger Setting
Junk isn�t junk to everyone. There is trillions of tonnes of junk waiting to be plucked for free and sold for profit. A Scavenger�s job is to find, repair and return for sale. In Gaia soap operas, the Scavengers (Scavs) are romanticised relic hunters, sifting through jewels and art from before The Droid War. In reality, they are treated as the lowest of the low when it comes to ship crews, Scavs spend their time in dangerous wrecks, hunting out cargo and objects of value. Within these floating shipwrecks could be any manner of dangers: traps, dangerous equipment or even a stranded Droid.
Wrecks and abandoned colonies, still inside Human Occupied Space, have plenty of treasures and dangers alike. A persistent search of space rarely travelled is the home of Scavs, a long way from any Orbitals or colonies that could give assistance. Even if you did use a Gaia beacon to call for help, it could be days before any ship could get to you.
This Setting is designed to introduce you to Icar in small steps.  Your Character will begin with very little except the promise of great fortune. As you progress, you will acquire better technology and even your own spacecraft - either to serve your own personal goals or seek further fortune.
What is here 
This is the players section for playing a team of Scavs. It will introduce you to the rest of the crew non-player Characters  (NPCs) that will be played by your GM, help you create a Character, tell you how salvage works and introduce you to the Anadar Cluster, which is where you will be treasure hunting.
Salvage Vessels
A Salvage Vessel is a spacecraft normally converted from a decommissioned spacecraft of some another role, such as freighter or executive transport. The vessel normally has the following Characteristics:
� Large. Carrying in bulk saves on charges incurred at Orbitals. Larger items tend to have a better credits per tonnage price.
� Inexpensive. Created from salvaged parts and normally evolved from what is available at low or no cost. This leads to a Salvage Vessel being...
� Slow. An Salvage Vessel takes many years to Salvage one small area of space, returning to base only to off load cargo and sell on.
� Ad hoc shape. Unlike the executive or large trade vessels, the Salvage Vessels tend to be unsymmetrical in shape. This adds to the lack of appeal they have.
� Poor Condition. Most of the systems on board that do not directly aid the operation of the craft (Bioreorganisers etc) are normally of poor quality. This makes the standard of living generally low. 
Crew Members
Salvage Vessels have a very strict crew structure. In an emergency, everyone needs to know who is in charge and what their role is. Also, a crew structure allows the crew to have the feeling that they are advancing. The number of crew members are kept to a minimum and most have two jobs. In general they are split into Salvage Team and Home Team. All crew members work equally when in search of salvage, but when they approach a wreck, the Salvage Team normally enter the vessel whereas the Home Team remain on the Salvage Vessel. Every person in the Salvage team has a speciality, but they all share some areas of Skills. Most of the Salvage Team have technical backgrounds. 
The Botchery Clipper
Your first job on a Scavenger Vessel will be on the Botchery Clipper. A converted long haul freighter, the Botchery Clipper appears to be a typical Scavenger Vessel. On closer inspection the patchwork of modifications and improvements hide a multitude of sins and hidden areas. To anyone without stars in their eyes, it looks perfectly camouflaged for its job: a pile of junk. To romantics, it is gushing with quaint charm.
The Captain
This is the person who takes responsibility for their crew. The Captain manages the accounts and makes the final decisions. The Captain provides motivation and drive, striking the balance between a happy, well working crew and profitable hard work. When attending some salvage, the Captain  rarely leaves the Salvage Vessel (Home Team).
Ms Madeline Stuo
The Captain of the Botchery Clipper is a tough woman of 62 years old (21st Century Earth time about 35 years old). Before buying the Clipper from another Salvage firm, she spent 15 years as a technician on the Drackis Orb, Remmar. A thin and harsh woman, she speaks very little and is going grey early. She insists on uniformity within the crew and thus wears a one piece environment suit just like everyone else. Captain Stuo has loose morals and can make some very quick and cold decisions. Too thin to be attractive and with long black hair invariably tied into a bun, she often appears older than she is. 
The Medic
Every commercial Vessel requires a medically trained person before any other crew members are employed. The Medic is the second most important person on the ship, with them, the ship may not operate (there is no law but generally accepted canon). The medic often has plenty to do on an Salvage Vessel, from dealing with injured crew members returning from a dangerous Salvage mission to making sure the Captain spends enough money on the medical bay equipment. The medic only leaves the Salvage Vessel  in dire circumstances (Home Team). 
Dr. Sorex
The Medic on the Botchery Clipper is an Automaton of Dorian design. Educated with some of the best medical programs available, there is not an illness he cannot cure. Unfortunately, he hates his owner, the Captain. Her loose  morals and lack of respect for the lives of living creatures goes against his very deepest soul. Having dealt with this kind of laissez faire attitude to life has made him bitter and cynical, giving him the worst �bedside manner� imaginable. Although humanoid in feature and shape, the metal skin (which he says is a reminder of what he is) that covers him is poor testimony to his complexity of design.
The Chief Tech
The last part of the Home Team is the chief Tech. This person makes sure that the Salvage Vessel is not in danger and keeps the systems on board in fine working order. The Chief Tech is often made second in command and spends most of their time between engineering areas and the bridge. The Salvage Team normally report to the Chief Tech.
Iss Horn Barnarder
Known as �The Chief�, Iss Horn Barnarder, is one of the most experienced Scavs in the trade. At the over ripe age of 102, The Chief has been on Scavenger Vessels since he was 10, �retiring� to the Home Team only 20 years ago. The Chief is very much like a father to the crew and treats them all with respect. Unfortunately, he is a �soft touch� and although he could stand up against the often heartless will of the Captain, he always backs down. The Chief is human, bald and walks with a limp. 
The Chief has many stories and rarely attempts to tell the same one twice. He misses the excitement of being in the Salvage Team but understands that the team on the wreck need his support back on the ship.  
Scavenger Characters
The Player Characters play a Scavenger Team. This team is often ordered to go onto places which are dangerous and must scavenge items that can be sold on later. This must be done quickly. Every member of the team costs money to keep on board, so each member has to prove their worth with every trip. If a member of the team is not pulling their weight, then they are likely to be fired at the next port. It is rarely the case that a whole Scavenger team is lost while on Salvage. This is tragic and leads to the main ship returning to port to hire a new team. 
People join Scavenger Vessels for a huge variety of reasons, from the desire of adventure to escaping responsibilities. New teams are difficult to form from scratch, people are suspicious about an Salvage Vessels requiring an entirely new team.
Character creation should be performed using the process outlined in Character Creation Overview on page 2.
The New Botchery Team
I was bored. I saw an advert for a Scav Away Team. I knew that Scavenger Vessels are not as prestigious as freighters, but then a freighter is not nearly as exciting. And they require you to be qualified first! I needed experience to join a freighter crew and needed to join a freighter crew to get experience. Experience was not a problem on a Scav. They�ll take anyone with a heartbeat.
So I turned up and seemed to have what they were looking for skills-wise, there were some others there too. An old man talked to us, he told a story about how lonely and cold space is but how rich the rewards can be. Then the Captain, who was this old woman in a jumpsuit said a few words and that was it. We were to leave tomorrow. We�d not even been shown the ship! One of the other new recruits said that this was probably a good thing.  
Character concepts
If you can�t think of a Character concept straight away, then choose one of the concepts below and then build and twist it as you play. These are just examples, please feel free to invent or twist the ones that are here. They are designed to give you a jump start into the Character. After you have chosen concept, move onto getting a Skeleton.
All these concepts refer to a small space station called an Orbital. You do not have to start there. If you have a better idea, suggest it to your GM to see if it fits with the starting plan.
Idealised School Leaver
You�ve left School, you�re 18, you know your subjects well and now your ready for the gargantuan Galaxy. Your parents are hassling you into joining some technical division of the Orbital on which you live, but you want more excitement than just fixing people�s ablution cubicles. You�re proud, impulsive, enthusiastic and have a naive and inaccurate view of space travel. 
You�ve secretly read about Scavs, listened intently to stories and it sounds like the life for you. You want everyone to like you and be part of a family that fights through adversity. Fortune is less important, riches can come later. The small Orb you come from is just too hick, you want to see the stars and fly through nebulae!
Ex Convict
You made a few mistakes and you�ve done time on a Star Enforcer prison colony. You have no money and are sick of living in the Orbital�s sheltered accommodation for rehabilitation. The only jobs that are open to you are the ones no-one else wants. You have to get off this bloody Orbital but no trade vessel will take you. You need employment with someone who won�t ask questions - and won�t mind if they find out you�ve done time. You�re worldly wise, courageous (only the weak obey the law), humble and fearful of committing crime.
Waster
You�ve wasted you life away with avoiding work and having fun. You need to prove to yourself that you�re not worthless. You�re a kind person, but the Skills you have are not accredited and you can�t get a job. You�ve worked hundreds of dead end jobs that would be done by an Automaton on richer colonies. 
You didn�t stick at any of them. Being on a Scavenger Vessel sounds more interesting than serving fat businessmen their food and will give you an employment record. If you don�t like it after a few days, then you can just leave. You�re not really into the whole danger thing, just a steady pay packet and some respect.
Sociopath
You don�t like large numbers of people and you have a temper problem. You don�t like crowded areas. You don�t like authority too much. You will go with the crowd, only if the crowd are going your way. You want to fight for life a little, but the authorities won�t allow you to express yourself. You�ve been told to leave the orbital. You know all the conspiracies, you tap into all the main information sources and you find it difficult to trust people. The Scav is the best place to be, no conspiracies, no trouble, otherwise you�re dead. Perfect.
Failed Trader
You lost your ship. You had it all, a crew, respect and your own damn vessel. Now you�ve lost it all. You just didn�t know when to be humble and listen to others, your selfish and foolhardy manner has meant the end of your career. And now, you�re reduced to this: a bloody Scav, the lowest of the low. You were great and you will be great again, if only the bitterness would go.
Dreamer
Where science and art met, you lived. Right on the edge of it all. The money dried up. You don�t really understand why, it just went. You�re virtuous and honest to the point of self destruction, but without art, your fiery temper has nothing to vent itself on. You need a job but your qualifications are not enough for a trade vessel, so the Scav sounds like the best place. They�re all oddballs, they�ll appreciate you. 
Mid-life Crisis
You�ve spent your life playing it straight, working for Corporations making pointless rubbish for a virtual world. You�re 60 years old and you�ve spent them all playing it safe, taking no risks. You�re fit and healthy and have lead a good life. Now you want to have the excitement you have been missing. You�re not going to like the step down in living standards that the Scavenger Vessel is going to offer but it will be worth it for the adventure! Now you will know what it is like to really live.
Skeletons
You have chosen your Character concept. This is what makes your Character tick. Now this needs to be wrapped around a skeleton. Many of the skeletons look very similar. This is because what makes a Scav Character unique is the Character concept. You will notice that each skeleton has a primary and secondary role. This only suggests the sort of Skills they have and what their function is, do not think this is a restriction to how you can play your Character. Normally, you get one of each type in a crew. 
The detail of each skeleton is given at the end of the Scavenger Setting, just before the GM guide.
Security
Your main job is ensuring the safety of the rest of the Scavs. Your technical knowledge is used to make sure the wreck you are salvaging is safe to work on. You are the one with the gun.
Weapon Skills and general tech.
Rayengine Technician
You are the Hacker, computer freak. Quite often, you are needed to open airlocks using Gaia or source information from the wreck�s computer (such as logs or cargo manifests). Before a mission, you will research Gaia to see if any information from before the Droid War is useful.
Gaia/Hacking Skills.
Colony Technician
When it comes to the technology behind colonies, you are the best. If it is on or under the ground, you know what to get and from where. You can open up the systems in minutes. You also know about explosives, getting in and out is important!
Colony technology Skills and explosives.
Zero G Technician
If its in space, you know about it. You are the main drive on most scavenger operations because you know the most about floating wrecks. Operating without gravity comes second nature to you.
Spacecraft and Orbital Know Skills.
Human Resources
Often, the crew of the wreck are not quite dead enough. At this point they need to be sorted out. Also, you know what gets good prices and what the market wants. You are the dealer. The Human resources member also have the task of finding new crew members when the Captain is busy.
Street and Trading Skills and Empathy / Persuasion.
Special Skills
The following Skills are possessed by all Scav Team members. They do not appear elsewhere and count as specialist Skills used only by Scav Team members. As the Scav Team members are usually new to the job, they begin at starting levels. If a Character is to have experience in the field, then they are to begin with (5 x Wit)+10 percentage.
Zero G Operations
Shift Shift Wit. Instructor.
Operating in Zero G is not easy for most, it can be disorientating and difficult.  Zero G can also be used in favour of the worker, taking the strain and weight of tools. When entering Zero G conditions (each time), this Skill must be rolled. If pass, then no further effects. If fail then the user will find every task at Hard modifier.
Mechasys Extraction
Shift Wit Wit. Self Taught.
Requires: Possession of any �Systems� Skill.
When removing parts from a wreck, it must be done quickly and without damaging the item. This Skill is to be used when an item is not easily removed. First, the appropriate Skill is used and if this passes (at normal difficulty) then Extraction is used to remove it without damage. A pass will mean that the unit may be sold as new, otherwise a loss of money will occur.
Scavenger Operations
Scavenger Operations are dangerous but the dangers can be lessened by using a standard operating procedure. A series of guidelines that help stop problems before they develop and avoid putting the whole crew into danger. The steps below assume that the salvage is chanced upon. If the crew is tipped off about the location of a worthwhile wreck, then the first step is normally missed.
The timings �out� from the salvage are the number of hours until the team set foot on the salvage.
1. Long Range Detection
While Light Jumping through space, a non-astronomical object can be detected from afar (1 square on the cluster map either side of the route). Very little information can be gathered during Light Jump so the journey may be changed to take a jump nearer to the object. The scavenger Away Team may not be notified that the route is changing. This is normally between 10 and 12 hours out.
2. Approach
The Away Team are put on standby and begin equipping. At this stage there is no idea whether the wreck will produce anything of any value or not, although the Salvage Vessel crew are committing themselves to taking a closer look. This is 8 hours out.
3. Medium Range Scan
The Salvage Vessel will not Light Jump close to the object, it is dangerous to do so: sometimes space anomalies appear as objects on long range sensors. 
The Salvage Vessel leaves Light Jump and performs a medium range scan at about 6 hours out. From this scan, quite a lot of information can be gauged, such as type of wreck or colony and estimates of value are made. The Captain will decide whether to continue to the wreck or to move on based on the information presented and the expertise of the crew. A meeting is normally held post-scan for this reason.
If the crew has a Gaia technician, they will research Gaia for any information on the wreck. The Protected Junk List is checked to see if the wreck is on it (see Salvage Law).
4. Circuit of Wreck
A close range (5000km, further if it is a planet, moon or Orb) and 2 hours out, an information gathering circuit of the wreck is performed. By the end of the circuit, the Scavenger Team must be completely ready to begin. This final circuit will provide tactical and safety information for the Scavenger team. Life support and structural information is also gathered.
5. Salvage Team Briefing
1 hour before the operation the team are briefed by the Chief and the Scavenger Team leader. The particulars and jobs are set out for the team.
6. Salvage Mission
Zero hour, the team arrive on the salvage for their mission. The mission can take between 1 hour and 10 days depending on the size of the wreck or colony. The Scavenger Team work 30 hours and then rest for 10. If the Salvage Vessel is more than an hour away, rest periods are taken on the salvage, be it a colony or wreck.
7. Salvage Team Post Briefing
The Away Team return to the Salvage Vessel once either all of the salvage is collected or there is no more room on the Salvage Vessel. An inventory of all the equipment is taken and the team analyse how they can work better in future.
8. Depart
Any objects removed from the wreck are cleaned, catalogued and stored ready for sale. The Salvage Vessel either returns to base for sale and repairs or continues the search for more wrecks.  
Salvage Law
What constitutes Salvage? Is there still an owner? Salvage law was originally instated by the Imperium in 96002 and used technology to solve the question of ownership. Salvage is defined as:
Any item which has been discarded by the owner or where the owner is deceased and no claim has been made on the item. Upon locating Salvage, Star Civilisation must be contacted to register salvage rights. 
Star Civilisation handles all the claims over Gaia. Anything outside the Light Jump Net (and the umbrella of Gaia) is not covered by Imperial Law. Many objects are found and registered each day on the Protected Junk List including those that are registered by crews who must leave a craft due to systems failure. The abandoned craft will remain registered on the Protected Junk List for 50 years, after which it is available to anyone who wishes to salvage it. Of course, some Salvage Vessels will return a wreck to a Star Dock - for a fee. Colonies cannot be listed on the Protected Junk List, so salvage cannot be protected by the Imperium. If a Colony is abandoned and there is no clear owner, it�s a free-for-all.
Although this is the law, it is often the case that they are bent and broken. Many of the Salvage Vessels operate in areas where the Star Enforcer Fleet do not have a great presence. Whether this is piracy or not is down to your point of view.
Piracy
Piracy is any criminal act where a spacecraft is used for arrival and departure. Just about any crime involving Salvage Vessels and wrecks are considered piracy. Heavily armed freighters lie in wait for freighters laden with goods, ready for stripping. Pirates are well organised and choose their targets carefully.
Profit and Loss
Everyone on an Salvage Vessel needs to pay their way. If a crew member from either Home or Scavenger Teams are not pulling their weight then the Captain will fire them. Salvage Vessels do not make enough profit to accommodate wasters. Every Salvage Vessel has a daily running cost, including crew pay, repairs and food. When visiting an Orbital (which charges docking fees) the amount of salvage sold must cover the expenses for the next trip out. Therefore, a balance must be achieved between searching for and actually stripping a wreck. 
The Salvage Vessel has a maximum tonnage it can carry. Every item has a price/tonne. Bigger items tend to have a high price/tonne. Rare or high tech items are sold individually - normally bartered based on a percentage of list price (use the price list in the Appendix as a guide). Antiques are more difficult to value as an interested buyer must be found. All pieces must be evaluated and the Salvage Vessel only ever returns when it nears its tonnage capacity. 
Scavenger Equipment
All Salvage Vessels have their equipment customised. Every wreck that is encountered has a treasure trove of items that can either be sold or installed. This leads to a some inventive uses of spare parts and installation of nonessential parts, purely because they became available and are not worth selling. Although there is a large amount variation between the equipment and systems on different Salvage Vessels, there are some items which appear just about everywhere. They are outlined here (equipment sheets can be found in the Equipment Index). 
Orbihaul Shuttle
Designed by Forester, this Heavy Grav vehicle is used by all Salvage Vessels for travel to and from wrecks, carrying back any stripped items and for travel to colonies. It is extremely robust, quick and easy to repair and designed to be spacious. The Orbihaul suffers from being extremely slow and poor handling. These are not considerations for Scavenger crews who require space and reliability.
Shakespeare Tech Kit
This tech kits has everything a Scavenger Technician requires in a handy body harness. See Shakespeare Universal Tech Kit on page 94.
Moss Environment Suit
An unarmoured space suit which survives extremely hazardous environments. The Environment Suit is a lightweight boiler suit in the blue and grey colours of the Botchery Clipper. For more information see Moss EV Suit on page 91.
Anadar Cluster
Situated in the very heart of Remmar�s Darkspace, Anadar is an unruly frontier Cluster. Due to a thin Imperial presence, Darkspace is a dangerous place to scrape out an existence.
Anadar has only a handful of colonies which cling tentatively to their own existence. As the Imperium�s influence is weak, there is great opportunity in Darkspace for a new Imperial Peer. Two powerful industrial families have risen to the fore: House Granger and House Tacquent. These two families battle economically for control of Anadar by helping fledgeling colonies grow, using fleets of freighters to supply colonies and acting as much like an Imperial Lord without having the power or recognition.
Freighters regularly make the Darkspace crossing from Hub to Rim sides of the Sector. There is too much volume for the Star Enforcers to cover, so piracy is rife. 
Anadar was not always a frontier system. Before the Droids invaded it was a haven for wealthy patrons of the arts and the artists they funded. Now, the sparseness of colonies make it an ideal den for pirates and criminals.  
Corisk
The System of Corisk is a shining light in all of the Darkspace clusters. The first to be re-colonised after the Droids were swept away, Corisk is unique in that it has had enormous levels of Imperial resources used upon it. The Imperial presence here is obvious too: shining new Mex Cities, a high density of farming on its two inhabitable worlds, a refurbished Orb and profitable mining wherever possible.
Florence and Penelope
Two of Corisk�s fifteen worlds are inhabitable.  They are called Florence and Penelope and orbit directly opposite each other. Florence is the largest planet and the climate is temperate, controlled by a complex interaction of moon gravitational pulls and a brand new atmosphere generation plant. Florence has seven moons, all of which have thriving mining colonies.
Penelope is moonless and has a wide range of climates from iced poles to a desert equator. In orbit around Penelope is the Boudika Orb, a clean and well tendered Orb whose ordered inside surface looks like a botanical garden. A healthy rivalry exists between Florence, Penelope and the Boudika Orb. Corisk is as close to a typical Imperial system as you will find in Remmar.
Friction with Tacquent
The Corisk System does have its problems. The Imperium have abandoned attempts to repair the spacecraft dock in Boudika Orb - which would allow repairs to spacecraft. Crewing the spacecraft dock became impossible with Tacquent�s aggressive employing of technical staff on his Colony of Essofin. As such, Essofin remains the only place where spacecraft can have repairs. The same is true for technology manufacturing, which Essofin has cornered all of the experts.
Essofin
Essofin is the home of the self-styled Lord E. Tacquent and his dynasty. Acquentia, a single inhabitable world of tropical climate is the focus of this seven planet system. Essofin is run entirely by the Tacquent dynasty. All the major corporations in Essofin are owned by Tacquent family members. 
Essofin is prosperous, built upon a technological manufacturing empire. The Tacquent industrial cartel allows the economy to remain stable and huge taxes to levied. Lord Tacquent claims that the taxes are ploughed back into Essofin but as strict numbers are not published, it is difficult to tell whether this is the case.
Acquentia has several moons (one of which, called Prometheus, is also inhabitable) and many Orbitals.
Falling out of favour with the Tacquent family is bad for business as taxes are levied against companies not owned by a Tacquent family member.
Part of Essofin�s success is its excellent law and order record. Essofin has a civilian police force called The Metropol who tirelessly work to keep criminal elements off Essofin. By entering the system of Essofin, you agree to sign up to an augmented set of Imperial law and also sign away some of your rights too. The Imperium is not happy with this arrangement but does not have the resources to deal with it.
Obyrworld
Obyrworld is a single planet in the Amo system. The other planets of the Amo system were destroyed in one of the most bitter defences of The Droid War. The system is littered with planetary debris in the form of asteroid belts, leaving only Obyrworld intact.
Obyrworld is circled by a set of rings, the remains of three Orbs, which were destroyed by colonists trying to stem the tide of Droids. The rings consist of technological fragments of these artificial moons, rich in both danger and reward. The Imperium classifies Obyrworld�s rings as simple �You�re on your own�. The number of objects is too great and the movement too chaotic to simply scan for valuable goods, the only way to find salvage is to get in amongst the debris, much of it the size of large cities.
The planet surface has an unpredictable climate. A single remaining atmosphere generation plant fights to keep the air breathable and surface temperate. Within a week, the weather can change from desert conditions to tundra and then tropical forest. Only the toughest plant life can survive such epic changes.
The lethal rings of Obyrworld entice hundreds of green Scavenger crews but the danger is not just Newtonian; pirates are known to operate around Obyrworld. Small Orbihauls sift through the remains of the Orbs, selling their wares back on the planet surface and the pirates pick them off with alarming regularity.
Dess-Kay-Dar
A system rich in both minerals and chaos. There is a running joke held by people who do not live there that Dess-Kay-Dar has a �Government for every season�. Dess-Kay-Dar has two colonies: Fexor is the prime colony, an inhabitable fourth planet, who�s landmass is sparse amongst massive seas of water; Parachania is the fifth in the system, a rocky planet whose valuable mineral resources has lead to a sprawling sub-surface colony that can house hundreds of millions.
To list the factions fighting for control on Dess-Kay-Dar would be impossible. Shifting politics, allegiances and alliances make for a very volatile situation. Couple that with inter-colony rivalry, an almost inexhaustible supply of hired mercenaries and business unchecked by the Imperium and you have a vibrant and unruly backdrop.
There is never an outright war in the system of Dess-Kay-Dar as that would scare off the trade vessels but tempers do flare and bring with them riots and quelling.
Kale
Loved by its colonists, Kale is a system of only one colony and a thriving food industry. Founded on Humanist ideals of peace and love, Kale uses only machines that are absolutely necessary for them to live and communicate with the outside world.
The colony is on paradise planet of Harramunda, the 6th planet of the system. At the time of The Droid War, Kale only had a few thousand inhabitants - all of which evacuated safely, leaving the world untouched. The Droids passed by the near-empty planet to concentrate on areas where there were higher densities of humans.
Automatons are banned on Harramunda. Any spacecraft based Automatons (such as spacecraft avatars) must remain on board.
Pri-Sot
Pri-Sot is a system somewhere between myth and reality. Referred to in pre-Droid war media as a utopian paradise for artisans and their patrons, it is one of the reasons Anadar was ever famous. What makes Pri-Sot a myth is that its location was only ever shared by word of mouth and has since past into obscurity. There are Scavenger Vessels dedicated to finding Pri-Sot, although the crews are treated with some considerable contempt.
Rhot Orb
Rhot Orb holds a planetary orbit in the system of Rhot and is remarkable because it was largely untouched by the sweeping obliteration of the Droid army. The Orb�s automated processes have continued to function since The Droid War and the plant life inside has long since taken over.
Rhot Orb has always been a favourite location for tales of hidden treasure. The most whispered story is of a pirate fleet who took refuge there when the Droids came. When they realised that the Orb was to be left untouched by the Droids, the pirate fleet took the Orb over and used it as a base of operations and a place to hide valuables they stole. After a year of stockpiling treasure there, the pirate fleet met the Droids head on and was destroyed.
Power and Influence
Like any Cluster, Anadar has its fair share of local celebrities and companies. This is not an exhaustive list but gives those that you would have heard of.
Lord E. Tacquent
At 54, this industrialist and trader is a growing influence in Anadar. Based on Essofin, the self-proclaimed Lord Tacquent is a harsh man who runs a tight police state where little crime exists. Tacquent has publicly denied any aspirations for Imperial Peerage nor does he want any Imperial presence on his system. Any publications about Tacquent are carefully controlled, so little information on Gaia is available. It is undeniable that Essofin is the most profitable system in Anadar.
Tacquent heads a family that acts like a dynasty. The family is huge and controls all of the main industries on Essofin. 
The Fleet of House Granger
The Fleet of House Granger is the name given to a nomadic fleet of spacecraft that roam Anadar. The fleet is huge and consists of gargantuan ancient spacecraft. The Grangers have a calm and respectful outlook and as such those that work and live in the fleet are happy to do so. The fleet is self-sustaining and stops at systems to off load food and manufactured technology while picking up raw materials. It is best to think of the fleet as a roaming planet. They are not a trade group as such because they do not work routes back and forth between planets.
The Granger family tries to keep out of the spot light, although it is their wealth (and investments held in Sayshell Sector) that allows the fleet to ride through economically hard times. They lend their name to the fleet but are not a controlling influence. The fleet is managed in a democratic way and it is believed that a member of their council works for Star Civilisation. The fleet of Granger are banned from Essofin.  
The Pinnacle Trade Group
The Pinnacle Trade group is an umbrella corporation for lots of trade vessels throughout Anadar. It is where everyone wants to work. Good pay, working conditions, leave, uniforms and perks. Planet leave is always in places that are interesting and the hours tend to be short as the crew runs in many shifts. Often the Pinnacle trade group spacecraft fit cabins and improve their facilities, making the vehicles very comfortable for passengers and crew alike. 
The pay on these ships is normally so high that any other job would require a massive pay cut and thus the crew-turnover is small. This in turn creates a family atmosphere. Most of the spacecraft are freighters but there are the odd one or two Scavenger Vessels.
The Undertow
The Undertow is a Scavenger Vessel that is similar to the Botchery Clipper in every way. As such you would have found out that they are the bitter rivals of the Botchery Clipper crew.
Epilogue
You now have all the information required to play the Scavenger Setting. Unlike most settings, the Scavenger setting requires more guile and less guns. This leads to more roleplaying and clumsy fist fights.
Also, as a Scav team, you might feel like you are being railroaded along a linear path for the first few sessions. This is normal in any setting and is set this way so that you can get to grips with the system and setting long before having to make decisions for yourselves. The missions will give you momentum and help you learn the system, the setting itself is of sandbox nature and choice will be there if you want it.
In the Scav setting, death is common. The only armour you have is your Environment Suit. The group begins with one gun and none of you are really combat ready. As long as you hold back on the gun-ho attitude then you can keep making it through.
Don�t be afraid of exploring the Botchery Clipper or asking the Doctor and Chief questions, they are likely to answers truthfully as they dare. There are some things that are counted as the Captain�s personal business, but then, if you�re the sort of person to poke around, then why not ask? She can only say no.

Over the next few pages, are a few example Skeletons to choose from. If you have an idea for a character that doesn�t quite fit with a Skeleton then the GM may let you make a new Skeleton. The GM has some notes in the GM section on how to build new ones.
Remember that a Skeleton does not determine all you can do in the crew - only what you are best at. As your Character grows, you will buy more skills and either carve a niche or broaden your Character�s abilities.
Scav Security

The Scav Security is there for the safety of the group and is a good choice for the group leader. They are the tough fighter in the group and are the only one that understand how to fire weapons and is fight hand to hand. The Scav Security is responsible for the safety of the team, if any die during a mission then the Security will be held responsible.
Security also extends to operating on board the Scavenger Vessel. It is important that no harm comes to the spacecraft. During space combat, Security will always be manning the guns, unless they are boarded!

Human Resources 

Although a general technician during the mission, the Human Resources team member provides common sense and non-technical points of view. This is very useful in a mission because Tech types will become engrossed in the technical problem, whereas Human Resources is there to see the bigger picture. Wrecks are often left in a state that tells a human story - part tragedy but often with a tale of hidden riches.
Human Resources will also be able to make snap appraisals on the worth of nontechnical items such as people�s personal effects or artwork.

Scav Engineer 
 
The stereotypical Technician lives in their environment suit and works every shift when they�re not sleeping. There is always something to fix on the Botchery Clipper and on missions you�ll be needed to force open airlocks; hack into data stores and Gaia cards to find out what happened to the crew; stop the spacecraft from burning up in orbit and then fix the Orbihaul, which took a nasty knock on its way in.
