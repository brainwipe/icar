# Overview
Icar is set in 92028 AD, an evolved human race is is spread along one arm of the Milky Way, ruled by a benevolent government called the Imperium. A second race of sentient robots called _The Droids_ are determined to eradicate its human creators and would have done so had it not been for their own internal civil war. Humanity thrives and prospers while the Imperium's navy, The Star Fleet, protects them from obliteration. 

Within Human Occupied Space, trade spacecraft jump between star systems; huge corporations mine, refine, build and expand; automated agriculture ensures food aplenty, planets are terraformed, enormous sphere space stations are built, people communicate instantly in the virtual copy of Gaia, and most live out a happy existence without fear or hunger  and with enormous social freedom. Criminal syndicates work in the margins of society, avoiding the Imperium Star Enforcers and living out their own power struggle.

Humanity does have a split of its own but it is philosophical. Humanists believe that natural evolution without technological interference is nature's greatest strength. Technologists believe that the next evolutionary step is to merge with machines. Every colony - and human living there - will be somewhere on that spectrum; it's only when the very limits of those philosophy are embrace does trouble ever occur.

## The Imperium
The Imperium is a benevolent organisation governed by an Empress and composed of many Chambers, each governing an aspect of humanity's development. Outside of these Chambers are the Imperial Peers who are Lords and Ladies who are given their own volumes of space to look after; and the Star Industries: Star Fleet, Star Scientifica, Star Civilisation, Star Enforcers. 

Star Fleet is tasked with defending humanity from external threats, such as the Droids. Star Scientifica makes sure research continues apace, Star Civilisation looks after human welfare, education and medicine and the Star Enforcers are the police. The Imperium uses an Artificially Intelligent (AI) machine called The Nexus to act as impartial judge and communicator between the Star Industries. The entire Imperium is driven by a civic duty that if they were not to continue their work in the interests of the human race, the Droids would soon win and the human race would be lost.

Corporations, although driven by profit are not considered to be evil. They too have a civic duty to the human race, a fact the Imperium is quick to remind them of. There is a single currency, the Imperial Credit. Banking is illegal.

## Geography
Human Occupied Space is split into three Sectors and each Sector is split into a huge number of clusters. A cluster is a group of stars that geographically are nearby and have a shared economy. A system is a series of planets orbiting a single star. Most Icar campaigns will take place across one or two Clusters.

Humans live in Colonies. A Colony is normally on or under a planet's surface and is built using a set of standard building blocks called Mex Buildings. A Mex City is a large number of Mex buildings formed into a lattice. People also live on spacecraft (space ships) and in space stations, called Orbitals and Orbs.

## Technology
Travel between the stars is easy and cheap. Spacecraft are numerous and much of a Colony's economy depends upon selling goods to other planets or systems.

Humanity communicates using Gaia, a virtual world that is a copy of the real world. Gaia is immersive and the detail is such that in popular places, the five senses can be completely mislead. Communication between two locations in Gaia is instantaneous, regardless of the real world distances involved. Gaia also contains astronomical data on all known star systems, and is used as a navigational aid aboard all spacecraft. Most people use their real world appearance in Gaia but the more avantgarde use any form or shape they feel like. Gaia is free to use in public holorooms but advanced (and business) users will have a Gaiacard, which can store programs (called Entities) and information. You cannot be killed through Gaia.

The human race have created a secondary race of machines called Automatons. These intelligent machines differ from the Droids in that they are unable to cause harm to humans. Automatons can be found everywhere and in all shapes and sizes, from humanoid receptionists that are indistinguishable from humans to automated cargo haulers called 'Hoppers'. Every Automaton has an owner but there are those fighting for their rights to be considered as equals. Most humans have an uneasy distrust of Automatons, regardless of their proven safety.

## Humanity
The human race has evolved and as it did so, it split into different Genuses. Common humans are Genus 1. The Genus 2 mutation is a zombie-like race who are poisonous to the other Genus (that the Droids were designed to kill). Genus 3 are a rare race of humans with 'psychic' powers. The Imperium does not recognise their existence publicly.

Philosophically, the human race can be split into three groups: Technologists, who believe that the future of the human race lies in technology; Humanists, who think the opposite; and Akarakians who follow a philosophy of Futurism, based around ideas of the end justifying the means. There are no major religions or superstitions.

The human race augments itself with technology and all birth defects can be rectified. Bionics include under-the-skin bionics called Cyberware, limb-replacement bionics called Borgware and minor genetic modification called Bioweave. Some people embrace this technology for its benefits but the general human populace fear those with powerful augmentations and so are less popular as you might imagine.

## Syndicates
Not everyone plays by the rules. The Imperial Nexus's exceptional information and resources, petty crime is easily solved. Crime syndicates are a reaction to the Nexus, highly organised groups of people that seek to gain power, make money or subvert society. Syndicates tend to be either Humanist or Technologist in belief and this generates considerable conflict.

# The Galaxy
The Milky Way galaxy contains approximately one hundred billion stars. It is one hundred thousand light years in diameter and bulges in the middle sixteen thousand light years thick. The galaxy is populated by two species. Only one hundred million of the stars in the Milky Way hold stable systems, the others are either engulfed in Nebulae, have no useful planets or sit within the penumbra. Of these systems, approximately ten million are populated by one of two species. The first, holding 95% of known space is the race called 'Droids', hostile to the other 5%, which is an evolution of homo sapiens. Many sentient species of lower intelligence exist, but do not have a bearing on interstellar affairs. The galaxy is broken up into areas called Sectors.

The Galactic Divisions picture shows a plan view of the Milky Way. Volumes 1-13 are situated in the Morpheus Arm of the galaxy, this the vastly explored area of the Galaxy, occupied by Droids and Humans alike. Around the edge of the arm are systems known as the Lone Systems, a region of stars that are far enough apart to make trade and defence unpractical. A small strip (about the thickness of the white line) that exists just outside human space is known as the Fringe, this is a more prosperous but unruly area of space. The humans class the Fringe as Lone Systems. 

Volume 14 is the Galactic Core, an impassible mass of energy at the centre of the Galaxy. Volume 15 is the opposite galactic arm called the Hypnos Arm, which is largely and uncolonised due to the huge distances involved. 

The galaxy is split into two arms, the Morpheus Arm and the Hypnos Arm. The Morpheus Arm is the only one documented in Icar, so is split into sections called Sectors. Within a Sector, stars form in clumps called Clusters. Around each star is a set of planets (stars without any planets tend to go unnoticed), a star and its planets are called a System. Only stable Systems are considered for colonisation, unstable Systems include those with unstable or multiple stars or those near space anomalies. Space is considered as being 2D as the Galaxy spins in one plane (although it is 3D, it is not very fat in its third dimension so is ignored for simplicity). Furthermore, the curves and anomalies of space are not listed on the diagrams.

## Droid Space
Droid Space is the name given to the huge volume of star systems that the Droids occupy. The Droids are an artificially intelligent race of xenophobic robots. Created by created by  Humanity to fight a war against a genetically poisonous race of humans. A flaw in their programming caused the Droids to turn on their creators, resulting in a massive loss of human life - leaving only 0.5% of the human race. Another flaw in their system was exploited by their creators and the Droids turned against each other. Droid space is split into factions, areas where the Droids have split into groups. There are approximately 5 million different factions. Every system in Droid space is utilised in the most optimum manner, mostly for the creation of more Droids and support facilities.

The Droids are an extremely powerful race with incredible resources, if at any time the many factions joined together, then a concerted (and successful) effort may be made against the human space. Until this time, the infighting amongst the Droids makes them ineffective against the humans. The emergence of the factions within the Droids does highlight another of their weaknesses, that they do evolve over time. There is a possibility that some factions may evolve into a nonviolent race. Droids are organised by Mark and Variant, the Mark is just a way of distinguishing type (by number), it is not a chronological marking. Variant is a chronological marking (by letter), the higher the letter, the more powerful the Droid is. 

Droids are extremely intelligent and will not give up until death. They have the ability to reproduce themselves (given the right resources) and can tactically gauge very complex situations from a very objective point of view. Their idea of self-worth only exists to aid a completed mission. The Droids will only sacrifice themselves if the number of kills it can get is more than continuing its existence. At the start of The Droid War, the Droids could program other machines to turn against their human masters. Since the advent of Gaia and the Gaia 2 programming language, Droids are unable to access any machines within human space. This has effectively made all vehicles and home-service Automatons safe from Droids forcibly altering their programming.

'Droid' is a specific name for this particular race of killing machines. Not all robots are Droids, only those programmed to kill are called Droids. More information on this distinction can be found in the Automatons section.

## Human Occupied Space
A small proportion of the Milky Way is controlled and inhabited by humans. The area of Human Occupied Space (HOS) is split into three sectors: Sayshell, Dorian and Remmar. The Human race is in a period of rebuilding and expansion, a post war era. All that separates the Humans and Droids is an invisible Light Jump Net: A web that temporarily stops spacecraft travelling at faster than light speeds. While disabled, humans can intercept and destroy the Droid craft. Human Occupied Space is controlled by a benevolent organisation called The Imperium, without which chaos would reign and the Droids would surely invade and overwhelm with ease.

# The Imperium
The Imperium is a benevolent empire that is the guardian of the human race. The Imperium consists of a set of Chambers, each overseeing a particular area of the Imperium's operation. Overall power is assigned to an Empress who is arbiter and leader. The core of The Imperium is a small organisation, employing only twenty thousand people. However, the Imperium has direct control of the 'Star Chambers', organisations under the pay of The Imperium who are the real power. The Star Chambers are Star Fleet, Star Scientifica, Star Enforcers and Star Civilisation

## The Imperial Chambers
he Imperial Chambers are the organisations within the Imperium that control the day-to-day running of humanity. The Imperial Chambers are filled with the brightest minds of the human race and number just three thousand. Each councillor has a menagerie of politicians, information brokers and analysts, making the Imperium appear larger than it actually is.

### Imperial High Chamber
This Chamber is actually made from two eminent councilors from each of the other Chambers. The Chamber deals with Imperial policy and is chaired by the Empress. The Empress has final say about all matters but normally the best solution is hammered out long before this Chamber sits in a meeting.

### Imperial Civil Chamber
This Chamber deals with colonisation and matters of power within the three sectors. The Civil Chamber also deals with expansion and grants for existing systems. The Civil Chamber is by far the largest of the Chambers  (at 300 personnel) and controls the majority of Imperial funds.

### Imperial Resource Chamber
The Resource Chamber controls the flow of money around the Galaxy. By controlling money, the control of inflation (which is practically unheard of) and the issuing of funds across the Imperium. This is similar to a 20th Century central bank but as there is no lending or other currencies, their job is considerably more simple.

### Imperial Star Chamber
This Chamber is made up from the heads of each of the Star Chambers. This Chamber allows each Star Chamber to vent their problems and help others to find solutions. The Empress sits as chair of this Chamber in most sessions. The Empress only speaks up when a disagreement occurs.

### The Chamber of Imperial Peers
The Imperial Peers are the Imperial Lords and Ladies who oversee the running of Clusters in Human Occupied Space. The Imperial Peers sit in session rarely, most disputes are settled calmly amongst the Peers from their home Clusters over Gaia. The Imperial Peers must sit in session together at least once per year, an event more to do with pageantry than political benefit.

## Benevolence
The Imperium is not corrupt as one might expect, they are by their very nature a benevolent organisation. It is understood throughout all the Chambers that their actions could save or destroy the human race. Any corruption is immediately rooted out and removed in a completely public manner. Such paranoia about corruption is seated deeply within The Imperium as the last time corruption was allowed to seep in, it lead to a massive inter-human war (The Aran War). Honour is key, no Imperial worker would dishonour themselves with corruption.

The Imperium is based in a crescent of systems in Remmar called The Imperial Crescent from where they gather information, hold festivals and allow people a place to voice their anxieties. The Imperial Crescent is a high tech and social model for the rest of the human race and attracts millions of holiday makers each year as well as businesses who believe that being close to the seat of power provides them with influence.

## Star Fleet
As the name suggests, Star Fleet is a fleet of spacecraft and warriors that defend the human race against the Droids. The Fleet is split into three Commands: Battle Command, Support Command and Colonial Command. Battle Command consist of all the spacecraft and warriors that do the fighting. Support Command deals with the logistics of keeping the Battle Command supplied and in good working order. Colonial Command visits systems within the Fringe, acts as negotiator and even offers Imperial protection to some of the more progressive systems. 

Star Fleet is equipped with the pinnacle of human technology to combat the Droids and has discovered tactics and methods for defeating them even when outnumbered. Many of the spacecraft in the Fleet (ranging from massive Battleships down to small and fast Clippers) spend their time patrolling the Light Jump Nets which surround the edges of the sectors that border with the Droids, waiting for any spacecraft to be caught in the Net. Star Fleet's foot soldiers are a legion of power armoured knights called Troopers, a select few of which become highly trained Special Forces and the very best are made into the Elite. Troopers are not grunts, they are highly educated, trained and professional fighting force.
The Fleet is based in the Turus cluster in Sayshell and have vowed that Sayshell will never fall to the Droids. The public rarely sees Star Fleet except when broadcasted by the Gaian News programmes. Gritty battles remain unedited at the request of The Fleet. Some colonies with a strong leisure community might be chosen for leisure time for the crews. Troopers and pilots like to party and often take over bars, clubs and entire pleasure resorts. 
Star Fleet and the general public

Civilian spacecraft Captains running expeditionary missions across the Light Jump Net will be scanned by Star Fleet as they re-enter Human Occupied Space. Although The Fleet is looking for the presence of Droids on board they will also scan for other illegal items but will hand the information to the Star Enforcers rather than spending time enforcing the law. The vast majority of the general public bear enormous respect for the members of The Fleet and appreciate the work that they do. It is common for a member of the public to approach a member of the Star Fleet and offer to buy them a drink, shake their hand or thank them.

## Star Scientifica
With colonies placed across such a huge distance, it was noticed that any scientific discoveries took many years to proliferate through the colonies. Star Scientifica (Star Sci) was created as a centre of academic wisdom and research. Many of the great scientists flocked to be part of the Imperium funded research. Star Sci is now highly secretive, many of the installations it controls are completely hidden about the galaxy (and some are even in Droid space). 
Many of the areas of technology researched are kept away from the public and are released when it is deemed safe to do so. This is seen as 'saving the public from themselves' and has proved to be a very good idea. Important new discoveries are fairly distributed to the companies which benefit from them, thus providing a periodic boost to technology without creating a technological monopoly.

### Organisation
Star Sci is organised by area of research. The research groups are known as the Elements and are split into Fire (pure theory), Earth (non-space application of pure theory), Air (biology, botany etc), Water (social sciences) and Void (anything to do with space). Specially chosen scientists from each of the Elements gather together at a Gaia space called The Quorum of Elements. Here they discuss problems and share major findings.
Star Sci and the general public

The general public will sporadically hear about corporations being presented with advanced technology or colonies being provided with a scientific solution to a global catastrophe. News stories regarding Star Sci are normally accompanied with a grin and raised eyebrows.

## Star Civilisation
When the last Emperor, Morius, died, his left a list of jobs for his successor, Empress Eshkar, to do. These were tasks he believed were vital but had run out of time to complete. Star Civilisation (Star Civ) was one of these. Star Civ was set up to make sure that every colony had adequate food, medical and educational facilities. Star Civ is responsible for:

- Ensuring food, water and air for all
- Educating people over Gaia
- Providing health care
- Creating, fostering new colonies
- Protecting independent colonies
- Housing and caring for those in hardship
- Issuing licenses
- Supervising and supporting colonial councils
- Choosing new Imperial Peers

Star Civ is the second largest Star Chamber (after the Star Enforcers) and has had a huge impact every human's life. Star Civ are pervasive throughout every facet of life from the cradle to the grave. Schooling at the start and geriatric care at the end. Through the rest, they are seen as helpful councillor and public servants that are impartial and kind.

Many argue that the Imperium wants to control what people think and the best way to do this is to control the education of children. This is purely conjecture and there are no indications that the lessons taught have changed in content. Children are actively encouraged to question the Imperium.

### Star Civ Healthcare
Doctors are paid a nominal fee for taking care of patients. These Doctors can be found on all space craft and colonies  and do not feed back information to Star Civ.

Star Civ also run trauma units where those that are badly wounded can be picked up and looked after by highly trained paramedics. The service is free but the patient is scanned. Star Civ Artificial Intelligences (AIs) can also assist over Gaia. The medical AI gives a +20% to a Medical skill roll for a Doctor in need of help or allows a non-medical person to stabilise the patient. 

The downside of using Star Civ is that the Nexus is always watching and will use the information it gleans from your medical emergency as evidence for Star Enforcers. Be careful that you do not implicate the patient - or yourselves in a crime by using it.

## Star Enforcers
The Star Enforcers (or simply The Enforcers) replaced a corrupt and under resourced interstellar police force (called the FEDS). Utilising their own fleet and resources, The Enforcers are able to keep excellent law and order on Colonies and in space around them. The Star Enforcers are split into four 'Divisions': Void, Investigation, Colonial and Justice. Void deals with the spacecraft and defends against pirates. Investigation deals with matters of interstellar importance (particularly dangerous criminals). Colonial is by far the largest of the divisions and includes all the police on colonies keeping law and order. The last division is Justice system and deals with imprisonment and execution (depending on local law).

### Getting away with crime
You might assume that with such advanced technologies comes the benefit of being able to tie criminals down with greater ease. However the Nexus requires the Star Enforcers to have huge amounts of evidence regarding the crime before a conviction can be made. This is because humans are fallible and any physical evidence (sensor footage, genetic information, sensor recordings in high tech buildings) can be forged. The only sure fire way of being immediately arrested and convicted is to perform a crime in front of a Star Enforcer. The more evidence the criminals leave over a series of criminal acts, the more likely the Nexus will request their arrest. Typical Criminal activities are listed in Typical Criminal Activities on XXXXXXX.

## Imperial Lords and Ladies
The Imperial Lords and Ladies (Imperial Peers) oversee and rule the three Sectors. By their very nature, they do not intervene unless called for, they are the emissaries of the Imperium and are figureheads of the systems they oversee. The general public see their Peer as the ultimate problem solver as the Peer is normally required to solve large, system wide problems. A Peer visiting a colony can provide a massive economic boost alone.

Funding is given to the Peers by the Imperium to award systems that have either shown promise or have fallen on hard times. The criteria for awards is largely left in the realm of the Peers. Other funding is often redirected into teams of troubleshooters and investigators under the constant pay of the Peer. These groups attempt to solve problems in a quiet and ground level way rather than using the large scale economic powers of the Peers.

Peers do not openly discuss their philosophical view points (as either Humanist, Technologist or Futurist) but they do influence their decisions. A Peer's philosophical belief is the topic of many bar conversations. In each of the Peer descriptions below, the philosophical belief assumed by the general public is given.

### Lady Tess Cannar
Lady Cannar is a tough, unscrupulous Dorian Sector Peer. Her severe bobbed hair, pale pallor and slight build gives her a sharp appearance. In dealing with colony councils and corporations, she is notably curt, brief and direct. When compassion is required for the populace, Lady Cannar transforms into a kind and caring maternal character. It is this convincing dual personality that is most unsettling for those who follow her exploits.

Before becoming a Peer, Lady Canner was the heiress of a large Dorian Trade Corporation but was more interested in people. Emperor Morius was taken by her 'People First' policies and made her an Imperial Peer at the age of 22. Assumed to believe in Humanist philosophy.

### Lord James Walker
Lord Walker is an upbeat, camp and outrageous Peer. The general public are in love with and perplexed by him in equal measure. His bubbly outgoing personality and fast talking hyperbolic speeches hide a shrewd negotiator and businessman. Lord Walker is mostly known for the perpetual party that erupts wherever he visits.

Before becoming a Peer, Lord Walker was a wealthy experimental artisan and was a household name throughout many of the clusters he now supervises. Assumed to believe in Humanist philosophy.

### Lord Stephen Lawrence
Lord Lawrence is a proud and serious Peer who speaks softly but demands respect. He is a gentle man, who takes the time to listen to anyone who takes the time to tell him their woes. Lord Lawrence works tirelessly for his people and was once ordered to have a holiday from work by the Empress - a holiday he spent inspecting leisure facilities on one of his Colonies. Lord Lawrence not a great economist, so takes his economic advise from a herd of advisers.

Before becoming a Peer, Lord Lawrence was a Star Fleet Stub Wing pilot, having served 15 years with the 2nd Stub Wing Fighter Squadron on the Star Clipper Relentless. Assumed to believe in Technologist philosophy.

### Lady Jacqueline Crowell
Lady Crowell is a young, energetic Peer who delights in asking difficult questions of those whom she meets. Fiercely intelligent and keen on understanding everything about each place she visits. This can cause embarrassment in those on the receiving end of the question but always commands respect from each witness. A relatively new Peer, Lady Crowell has rapidly gained a large following for her direct and positive attitude.

Lady Crowell emerged as a candidate from one of Remmar's wealthy families. Lady Crowell was spotted as a rising star while working in the Imperial Civil Chamber. Assumed to believe in Futurist philosophy.

### Lady Berrinda
Lady Berrinda is as fierce as her reputation. A fiery Character who throws her power and weight behind causes she believes in. Lady Berrinda spends most of her time at fledgling colonies, which has little economic affect but does improve the survival of young colonies.

Lady Berrinda came to Emperor Morius's attention when she led a fleet of 25 huge freighter spacecraft through 12 clusters of Droid space and across the Light Jump net into safety. Saving millions of lives, Lady Berrinda was halted from going back by being made a Peer. It is believed that this threw her into a rage that lasted a week - a belief that is rooted in truth. Morius appeased her by giving her clusters along the Light Jump Net edge of Remmar Sector (the Typhon side). Assumed to believe in Technologist philosophy.

### Lady Axa Erland
Lady Erland is the Imperial Peer in charge of the Akarak Nation. Although appointed by the Empress, Lady Erland was drawn from the Akarakian Elders. Lady Erland is a typical Akarakian and strictly follows the three tenets of hard work, expansion of the mind and a pragmatic view that the end justifies the means. For more detail see Akarak Nation on page 60.

###  Imperial Peer Trade Navies
Each Peer also has a Trade Navy. These spacecraft are owned and operated by the Peer. Trade routes which would not be viable for a normal trader will be given to the Trade Navy (as they do not need to pay taxes to the Peer). Trade Navies are resented by other trading firms but they are understood as a necessary evil. If a Trade Navy turns a trade route profitable, it is required to hand over that route to a trade company and turn its attentions elsewhere.

### Clusters and Peer Control
Most Clusters tend to stay under the control of the same Peer. However, the Peers can swap Clusters between them (as long as the general public vote in favour). Another method for changing Peer is when the Council of many systems  in the Cluster vote against the Peer. This is uncommon and frowned upon by the Imperial Civil Chamber. Normally, the Cluster will only vote against the Peer if there has been a serious miscarriage of justice.

### Peer Creation
Peers are chosen from a shortlist (compiled by Star Civ) of wealthy industrialists by the Empress and the position is a double edged sword - it's a position of considerable power  and influence but you cannot refuse if you are called upon to serve. Peers spend most of their time travelling between systems and as such do not have a seat of power. While en route between systems, business and problems are dealt with over Gaia.

# Corporations
Corporations tread a fine line between exploiting colonies and providing for them. The law is broad enough to stop Corporations from controlling colony politics. Corporations come in three sizes: Intersector, Intercluster and Local. Intersector corporations stretch across all of Human Occupied Space and include the biggest brands that have been around for tens of thousands of years. Intercluster Corporations tend to be localised amongst a few clusters in a single Sector. Local Corporations at the very most spread over only a single cluster. A list of well known and example corporations are included in the section on Corporations on page 62.

## Black Mills
Most Local and few Intercluster Corporations fund secret 'Black Mill' subsidiaries to influence the markets, steal secrets from competitors and even cause damage to other companies. Although illegal, Black Mills have become expert in evading the Star Enforcers and often make use of criminal Syndicates. Black Mills use the Undergaia to arrange missions, hire mercenaries and exchange private corporate data.

# The Sectors
The galactic arm is split into Sectors. Each Sector began life as an administrative zone, which then grew into a place where people would be proud of. Since The Droid War, all but three Sectors fell to the Droids. The Imperium built Light Jump Nets along the borders of each of the human occupied space sectors to stop the Droid ships just long enough for the Star Fleet to intercept.

The three Sectors under human control are Sayshell, Dorian and Remmar. Sayshell is the home of Star Fleet and having never fallen to the Droids, it is prosperous and very high tech. Dorian holds the reigns of production and is mostly industrial and trade orientated. Remmar, newly retaken from the Droids is the sector of expansion and new opportunities. Sectors can be further broken down into clusters.

A Cluster is a group of stars that are spatially close to each other. Clusters tend to have shared economies and trade as the distances for the transportation of goods is small. Separating the sectors from the Fringe and Droid space is a Light Jump Net. This net will stop any craft Light Jumping through it in either direction. If a spacecraft Light Jumps though this one light-year thick barrier, it will be pulled out of its jump and all craft nearby (including Star Fleet) are automatically notified.

## The Anatomy of a Sector
A Sector is represented as a flat map taken from above (looking down on the plane the galaxy spins in) for simplicity. A Sector is made from a mosaic of Clusters, which are groups of stars that due to their proximity share a common culture and economy. In ancient times, a Cluster would be considered a nation. As you move away from the centre of the arm, the number of Systems diminishes and Clusters are spread far apart. Light jumping spacecraft take longer to travel between stars in The Fringe and Lone Systems.

The Central Arm: The central arm is the name given to the bright section running down the centre of the sector.
Clusters: A line between each of the sections are the markings defining clusters. Those clusters that are dark have many stars, the lighter have fewer.

The Fringe: The area outside the Light Jump Net is the top and bottom edges of the image. The exception to this is the white line, which shows the Light Jump Net.

The Lone Systems: Those Systems on the very edge of the galaxy are far from Imperial control. A good definition for what makes a Lone System is that it takes at least ten days to travel to a Lone System.

## Sayshell
First populated in the 11th millennia, Sayshell began as a centre of learning and commerce. It remained so until Star Fleet moved its operations there during Aran War.  Since then, The Star Fleet has protected and looked after Sayshell more so than any other sector. When the war against the Droids looked like all was lost, the Fleet spontaneously retreated to Sayshell and with the aid of Star Sci kept the Droids out. This is the safest Sector in Human Occupied Space.

Sayshell's economy revolves around technology and learning with food production coming a close second. Comparatively little is actually manufactured in Sayshell, although most inventions originate there. Sayshell does not have any Imperial Peers in control, it administers its colonial councils through Colonial Command. Sayshell is by far the richest and most technological system in the human space, by living there you are assured a job, even if it is in Star Fleet.

## Dorian
The War of Dorian was the closing chapter of The Droid War, where Star Fleet had a limited presence (only due to its proximity to Sayshell) but the colonists who had retreated and fought their way out of every system up until then were not going to let Dorian and all its resources to fall to the Droids. Although the space was invaded, it was never entirely occupied, the human inhabitants giving a hard resistance. The Imperium soon took the sector back as the many systems yielded much needed resources that were not available in enough quantity in Sayshell. Dorian grew once more as the production centre of Human Occupied Space once the Droids were expelled. 

Now Dorian produces the most raw materials and technological goods of the three sectors and continues to grow economically. The Sector prospers despite poorly funded Colonies becoming technologically archaic. The people of Dorian prefer to fix only when broken, to do so before is waste. 

## Remmar
Remmar was the last Sector to be successfully evacuated, leaving many of the Colonies intact. The onslaught of the Droids was met with empty Orbitals (space stations) and booby traps aplenty. When the Star Fleet eventually pushed the Droids out 2 years ago, they opened up a Sector largely untouched by war.

Remmar is a fledgling sector with one very important resource: food. As the human race grew in the other two sectors, it was soon clear that it would be impossible to feed everyone with the food processing available. Huge effort was put into opening Remmar and when it was finally opened for the general public to colonise, a quarter of the human population flocked there to start up crofts (small, self sufficient farms) and rejuvenate empty colonies. Remmar's prime function is to produce food and allow private enterprise to flourish. 

Unfortunately, there is not yet enough resources coming out of Remmar to make Imperial Peers overseeing all the systems worthwhile. Star Civilisation is looking into assigning Peers to those places that are struggling.

# Clusters
A whole Sector is a large area to administer without further sectioning. A Cluster is a clump of stars arranged in geographical proximity (they are near each other) and as a result of this share trade and economies. A Cluster can be any number of inhabitable Systems from 2 to 20. Below is a list of Clusters which are important to note. Detailed descriptions for the Anadar Cluster is included in the Scavenger Setting on page 97.

Your campaign is likely to be based in any number of Clusters.  These Clusters are well-known and are detailed below as examples.

## Akar Cluster
The Akar Cluster was first settled in 4002 by Jebediah Akarak. Jebediah believed that to lead a long and healthy life both Mind and Body must be expanded and pursued. The first colonies starved as the colonies split their time evenly between encouraging their mind state and doing duties on the farms. This lead to many harsh winters where hundreds died through starvation. The food that was grown barely fed the populace, so little trade was possible. The cluster was quickly populated by people of the Akarak nation (many took surnames with 'AK' to show their affiliation) and slowly the wealth and power of these odd-ball people began to grow. This growth was massively aided by the Akarak Aid Fleet whose job it was to stop colonies from dying out.

Now the cluster is a thriving trade source as well as cultural centre. The strict Akarakian discipline lends itself well to trade as outside traders fell that the deal that they were getting will always be honest and fair.  The details of the Akarak nation are given later in the section Akarak Nation on page 60.

## Baleris Cluster
Situated on the border between Sayshell and Dorian, the Baleris Cluster location has been disputed since the original pioneers landed on Zeff Orb in 6295. The Cluster was soon absorbed into the Akarak culture but took a slightly different spin on their ideals. Baleris was a cultural centre for Akarakians, allowing the Akarak people to have more freedom from the constraints of the Elder's wishes. Times soon changed and the colonies in Baleris moved away from the Akarak way of thinking, it has kept its cultural significance and its leading system Acerine Prime is a good example of a system with all the good aspects of Akarakian ideas. 

## The Imperial Crescent
Deep within the heart of Remmar, the Imperial Crescent is a cluster that resembles a crescent if viewed directly from above the Galactic axis. The Imperial Crescent was populated extremely quickly and is the home of the Empress, Star Scientifica and The Star Enforcers. The technology of the Imperial Crescent is second only to Arcturus (Star Fleet's home in the Turus Cluster) but is also the centre of art and humanitarian issues as well. 
Many of the Interstellar corporations moved their operation to The Crescent purely for the prestige of being in the same cluster as the Empress. Trade, as you would expect, is blisteringly high around the cluster. The cluster also has a industrial edge, it is responsible for the production a huge amount of food which serves less fortunate clusters around it. The Imperial Crescent is a shining example for the rest of the human race.

## Naggachef Cluster
This cluster exists within the Nagga and Chef nebulae, two massive clouds of gas which exist 5 light years apart, swallowing most of the cluster. The patchy sparseness of the nebulae (compared to other nebulae of similar size) allowed Colonies to grow where otherwise it would have been impossible. When Peter Nagga settled the first colony with his wife-to-be Gill Chef in the latter part of 5998, the colonists who had taken the gamble were quite cut off from the rest of humanity. Most traders would not venture into the Nagga or Chef nebulae for fear of collision. Once the nebulae were correctly charted, the systems became very popular indeed.

Naggachef contains many systems within its nebulae, most of these systems have many I class planets (some terraformed) and great, untapped natural resources. The cluster has two major systems Prem-Nagga, a huge I class planet with a massive farming industry and Prem-Chef, a medium I class planet with a huge tourist and pleasure industry. Those on any system within Naggachef are delighted by the 'Nebularis' or 'sky lights', the patterns in space made by the two swirling nebulae. Never do any of the systems have complete darkness, there is always a glow of red, green or blue.
Naggachef is the main food producing cluster in Sayshell, turning out enough food to feed a third of the population of Sayshell. Subsidiary industries include production and tourism. 

## Niopak Cluster
'Niopak Primus Retaris' was first landed upon by James 'Niopak' Trenchard in 6156, life was very hard there. The colonists who settled there were more idealistic dreamers than realists. Artisans, writers, poets and drifters soon settled the many inhabitable planets surrounding Primus. They were not well suited to building and defending a colony but even through harsh winters, the Colonies grew. When the Romar Cluster began links in 6211, the colonies in Niopak strengthened, without losing the artisan core that permeated all the systems.

Today, Niopak is a very wealthy cluster, known for its fashion and for creating new trends and often being the centre of attention in Sayshell. Although there is quite a frivolous side to the Niopak cluster, there is a basis of hard fashion industry to support it all. Any item of day to day living is made fashionable, from Gaiacards to sports cars. Non-essential, yet highly sought after gadgets and trinkets are also produced in large quantities. 

## Romar Cluster
Populated by Romar Smith in 6002, the founder only remained on the founding system (Romar Grand) for a space of five years. In those years, he managed to set up a self sufficient economy. He soon realised that the remaining systems around Romar Grand were ripe for the picking and squeezed Romar Grand for the resources for setting up more colonies around it. Later, he bored of colonisation, Romar began setting up trade links with the colonies. When Romar was 56, he had managed to populate 10 planets and was training his two sons (Andrew and Simon) all that he had learnt. The Romar Cluster is now the most powerful economic cluster in Human Occupied Space.

Romar's strength is in its excellent adaption to changing needs. When Dorian opened, industry in Romar shrank, so they built extensive space docks to meet the demand for space craft. Currently, the Romar Cluster is gearing up to produce Orb Orbitals - huge space stations. Romar is often referred to as a 'Nomadic' Cluster as most of the cluster's inhabitants are traders who do not tend to spend too long in one place.

## Tef Cluster
Settled in 4142 by Norman Teffralliage (Tef), the Tef cluster is by far the most notorious and disreputable cluster in Imperial space. Within the Tef systems there are two sets of laws. The first set is Imperial Law, by which any respectable person goes by. 'Fralliage' law is the widely adopted law based on the principle 'You can do what you like if no-one is watching'. 

Corruption, theft, political overthrow are common place in Tef. However, people still enjoy living there because it is out from under the thumb of the Imperium while still remaining inside the safety of the Light Jump net. Tef also includes a very high percentage of I class planets (about 40%!), Although most of the climates are very harsh on those living there, they do still count as I class. 

## The Turus Cluster
Since the The Star Fleet was first created as Stella Fleet in 5800, the Turus Cluster (1 on the Sayshell Guide) has been its home. Boasting the largest colonies and Orbitals (space stations), the Turus Cluster is the centre of technology and learning. The Turus Cluster produces enough food to trade excess; training and spacecraft for the Fleet. Its excellent central position leaves it open to trade from the other Sectors and is by far the most advanced Cluster in Human Occupied Space. 

## Vitero Cluster
The 'Blue World' colony was founded in 6322 by Simon Vitero, from whom the Cluster takes its name. The ideals that the colony founded itself on were based within practicality. In the early years of colonisation, Vitero and his colleagues did well by saving time and effort for that which was absolutely necessary. The technological and agricultural output of the Blue World colony and the colonies that followed were excellent while the sociological advancements were minimal in the extreme.

Today, the Cluster still thrives on its principles of function rather than form. It is no surprise that the Mex building was designed here along with the laser-bladed harvester. Vitero also holds the headquarters of the Endotech shipwrights, along with a massive spacecraft manufacturing trade. The general public have little interest in visiting Vitero, which leaves its tourist trade dead and social colour bland.

## Earth, Sol System
Earth is the 3rd planet in the Sol system and the origin of humanity. After the rapid expansion of the human race, Earth become forgotten as it was a painful reminder of the horrors of war and the human race's barbaric past. Explorers often go looking for the location of Earth but never turn anything up. Most believe that Earth is now within Droid Space and not worth the risk looking for it.

The Imperium do not actively stop people looking for Earth but at the same time, they do not promote it. The Imperium claim that they do not know where Earth is, a favourite topic for conspiracy theorists.

# Colonies
A colony is the name given to a dwelling on or under the surface of a planet. A colony can be a city (called a Mex city) or high tech farming communities (called Crofts) or a combination of those. Colonies are normally set up on planets where there is a gravity strength appropriate to humans (around 1 earth gravity) although some colonies use spacecraft technology to provide a bubble of artificial gravity. A quarter of the human race live in space stations, called Orbitals but they are not considered to be colonies.

## Where Colonies Grow
Wherever there is a need for people to live, there will a be Colony. Colonies are built on planet surfaces (Prosurface), under the surface (Subsurface) or under oceans (Subaqua).

### Prosurface
Any colony on a planet where the air is nontoxic to humans is a Prosurface colony. Roughly 60% of colonies are Prosurface colonies. Earth in the 21st Century was a Prosurface colony.

### Subsurface
Any colony where the atmosphere is not breathable is called a Subsurface colony. These colonies are normally huge caverns buried deep within the surface of the crust, sealed to the harmful atmosphere. Within these caverns are cities, much the same as on Prosurface planets. Access to the colony is through many huge circular tunnels called 'vents'.

### Subaqua
Any colony built under an ocean of liquid (not necessarily water) is a Subaqua colony. Subaqua colonies are Cities built on the inside of giant spheres. Gravity in the spheres points toward the nearest inside face. All the buildings reach into the middle of the sphere. The large spheres are interconnected using a system of tunnels. Spacecraft dock on the outside of the spheres - space inside is usually too precious.

## Colony Buildings
The Droid War turned the human race into a race of refugees. A tsunami of people flooded from invaded Sectors into Sayshell. At first, they lived in repurposed spacecraft but those craft were soon needed to help other refugees and spark off trade. The Imperium responded with prefabricated buildings. 

There are two main types of building: Crofts and Mex Cities. Crofts are smaller buildings, made to house farms and holiday homes. Mex Cities are huge lattice structures with tall, straight buildings connected together with structural walkways, providing strength. Mex cities are by far the most popular buildings as they are cheap, very quick to construct and do not take up much of a footprint.

## Crofts
A typical croft building is a circular hut which has a domed roof. On the ground floor is where all the utility equipment is kept, including generators and for larger croft buildings and any vehicles. The upper floor is the living space. The more people that live in the croft, the larger the diameter of the building is to be. Every living space has a sky view through the domed roof and all rooms are on the edge of the building.

A typical croft has a diameter of 15 metres, large ones can go up to 50 metres. There are many different designs on offer, with many different interiors of all qualities. A simple Croft (including installation fees) costs 10 000 credits. Permission needs to be granted by the local Council (which it normally is) before one is installed.

## Mex Cities
Found in all colony types, a Mex city is made from many levels stacked on top of each other. Each level has a particular template so that level with differing purposes can be stacked easily. Each building stands alone, connected to other buildings by walkways which people walk through. Lifts run up and down the corners of the building, each powered by Grav.
Although this prefab system of building is normally followed, each system does have its own special character which can be seen in the colours and layout of the buildings. Mex buildings on very different systems sometimes look very similar in shape. Mex buildings tend to be very tall and thin, a normal size for a building would be approximately 4km high with a footprint of 100m square.

In Mex cities, there are many ways of travelling. Inside buildings, people travel by foot, to move up and down the buildings are extremely fast lifts that can traverse hundreds of floors in seconds. Free transport is provided in all Mex cities by the Free Mass-Transportation System (FEMTS) which are large bullet-shaped Grav vehicles that run methodical routes around the cities. Personal transport is provided by Grav Cars and Grav bikes which are flying vehicles that travel between the buildings.

Living in a Mex city would feel like a very strange experience to those in the 21st Century. People tend to work near where they live, even in the same or neighbouring building. Nearly all humans live in a Mex city in one form or another as Mex cities can be built anywhere. Mex buildings can be repaired and constructed very easily, they can also be added to by lifting off the top level and add more levels in underneath. 

### Mex in General
From a distance, a Mex city tends to look out of place within the landscape. This is because of the large square lattice work of the buildings. The edges of the city tend to be square and the can be built in any place (shown below in a valley). This is due to their sturdy structure and the fact that all vehicles fly in and out of the city, there are no need for roads, as such.

The ethos of the Mex city has lead to some standardisation in the layout. These standards are called The Imperial Polisat and they provide a perfect model for city designers to follow.

## Typical Mex Plan
### A. Town Centre
Pivotal to the running of the colony, the Town Centre is the home of all the main colony offices and comprises of several Mex buildings. The main building is the Council Office where councillors and their advisors organise new policy and manage planetary issues. Star Enforcer Colonial Building or SEC Building is where the Enforcers (Police) on planet reside. Often, the SECs have two or more buildings depending on size of the Colony. The Town Centre nearly always comprise of the tallest buildings in the City.

Star Civ have an important presence in the town hall. It is the location of their headquarters and also a central hub for the services it provides, including trauma clinics. A Mex city will have a large number of trauma clinics distributed around, the Town Hall will have several scattered between the top and the bottom.

### B. Home Gateway
The Home Gateway or Home Gate is the star craft docking facility that is used by smaller, private craft and the large passenger carrying Pitlifters that deliver people to Orbit and the Star Buses. Smaller berths with more commercial aspects (such as hotels, retail shops) are clusters around this edge. Traditionally, the Home Gate is normally a very well kept part of the Mex City as it is normally the first place that the visitors to the city will ever see. The Home Gateway has the feel of an old-fashioned 'airport', with people waiting to travel or moving away from the Gate area as quickly as possible. Local populace normally leave the inflated prices of the Home Gate for the tourists and shop elsewhere. The Home Gate is often locally called something else, named after a founder or famous space farer.

### C. Freight Gateway
This is the dock for larger spacecraft. These spacecraft tend to be huge hulks that carry a massive number of poly-ceramic-alloy space crates. Each of these freighters have only 100 crew but have many hundreds of automated 'Hoppers'. Hoppers are flying robots designed to carry space crates to and from the freighter. When a freighter arrives, a huge swarm of Hoppers move cargo back and forth. 

The Freight Gateway has few bars and cheap hotels. Many crews prefer to sleep on the spacecraft but the hotels offer a change of scenery, live music and a range of local entertainment.

### D. Hauler Port
Also situated at the base and on the edge of the city, the Hauler port is how goods are transported around the planet. A hauler is a large haulage vehicle which accelerates very slowly but can travel very fast indeed. This makes it perfect for long distances. 

Although mostly automated, the Haulers are normally piloted due to the mistrust of automated systems. Hauler ports tend to be poorer areas of the city as most of the Hauler pilots spend little time in the city, it is not looked after very well. The Hauler Port is also likely to contain many storage levels as it is not a desirable place to live.

## In a Mex City
The picture (on the next page) shows a view from within a Mex city. The picture is looking down the middle of the city. To people who have lived on Crofts their whole lives, the Mex City will feel  claustrophobic, overcrowded and busy. The space between the Mex buildings is packed with traffic (only a small amount shown in the picture for clarity). Due to the regularity of Mex levels, it is very easy to navigate around a Mex city. 

### A. Lift
Lifts travel up and down the corners of all buildings. Some buildings have lifts on the inside as well but the majority of people use the corner lifts. The lifts run on Grav and are not directly to connected to the building, so there are many (often as many as 200) lifts in one building corner. 

They are best thought of as independent Grav Vehicles that mainly travel vertically. Lifts travel at great speeds and one can travel at up to 20 meters per second (4 floors a second or 12 floors a game turn). Each lift has a powerful gravity field generator that keeps the occupants safe from the affects of huge accelerations. Lifts can pass each other in a corner, allowing lifts to overtake each other.

### B. Walkway 
Walkways allow people to move from one building to another and are structural tubes that connect the Mex buildings together. Mex Cities with many walkways form a tight lattice, making the city as a whole very strong. Toward the centre of a Mex city, walkways are common and become more rare toward the edge. Traffic passes above and below these walkways and they sometimes travel at angles between the buildings. In any case, the gravity inside of the Walkway is always perpendicular to its floor.

### C. Traffic
For those who can afford their own personal transport, there are flying cars called Grav Cars are used to move people around. As the volume of traffic in central areas of a city can be extremely heavy, people often choose to walk instead of driving.
Grav Cars fly through the city in lanes. Flying through the Mex City can be quite stressful to do at speed, so most people will switch on the Grav Car artificial intelligence and let it drive for them - picking the quickest route. An artificial intelligence will not break any driving laws and for those who want to dash through the City, they can drive on Manual (Pilot Grav skill check).

### D. Free Mass Transportation System
The Free Mass Transportation System (FEMTS) is available in all major Imperial Systems. The FEMTS consists of a huge number of bullet shaped FEMTS cars. Unlike most old-world free transportation systems, the FEMTS is normally the pride of the city, clean, reliable and always on time. FEMTS cars are unmanned, it is only the passengers who travel on it. The car is controlled by an artificial intelligence (AI power 2) which senses other traffic in Gaia and then makes decisions on the best route to meet its stops. The FEMTS is widely used by many, as a safe alternative to owning one's own car.

More affluent Cities adorn their FEMTS with bars, relaxation rooms, massage parlours and brothels. Regardless of their internal fittings, the external bullet shape is standard.

### E. The Nearground
The Nearground is the place where those not content with normal society go to live. See the later section The Nearground on page 40.

## Colony Council
Administration of the Colony is performed by the Colony Council. The Council is democratically elected every 4 years. Councillors are drawn from the wealthy, famous or purely on merit. The positions on the Council are: Chair, Industry, Treasury, Trade and Domestic. Two extra seats are appointed by the Imperium: Star Enforcer Captain in Charge and Star Civilisation Captain in Charge. Some councils have extra members depending on their local situation - such as a council member for Mining activities.

Councillors can serve as many terms as required and each Councillor is given a budget from the Imperium (via Taxes) and employs a staff. The taxes are used by the Council to grow the colony, provide services, perform maintenance on the infrastructure, subsidise trade negotiations and support flagging industries. Council Staffers wield much of the Council's power as negotiators and advisers to the Councillors.

The Council are constantly in the public eye, their decisions having real and often immediate affects on the population of the colony. Although there are no party affiliations, councillors often hold onto Human philosophies, by which they make their decisions (see Philosophy on page 59).

To understand, gain connections and make use of a colony's council, an Ecopolitical skill check is required.

### Chair
The Council Chair has the job of keeping order and making sure people do as they say they are going to do. The Chair is the public face of the colony and spends a lot of the day travelling around the reaches of the colony talking to people and investigating problems that might have been raised on a council meeting.

### Treasurer
The Treasurer is responsible for ensuring that the colony remains within its budget and that the Imperium is warned before they run out of money. Taxes are collected automatically by the Imperium over Gaia and the enforcement of tax collection is down to the Star Enforcers. Therefore, the Treasurer's budget is derived straight from an allowance from the Imperium.

More enterprising Treasurers will seek to boost this income with donations from wealthy people and corporations, although this is not expected of them.

### Industry
The aim of the Industry is to ensure that local businesses are supported and that there is fair competition on planet. The Industry Councillor also aids local businesses (using a budget) to help grow new industries or save important ones that are floundering.

## The Nearground
In most Mex Cities, there is an area which is known as the Nearground. Typically, the Nearground is the area 'Near to the ground' - the first 50 metres of each Mex building where light rarely filters do to. The Nearground is where anarchists, socially dispossessed, poor and criminal elements of society live and work. The Imperial society is a liberal one and the Nearground provides a space for the fringes of society to meet, away from those playing by the rules.

The Nearground is where the order of Mex architecture descends into chaos. At ground level, the Mex buildings are difficult to discern, the core layout of the buildings augmented by gantries, walkways and buildings in a high-tech shanty-town. There is little traffic in the Nearground - only Grav bikes are small and nimble enough to drive quickly through the maze of architectural imagination.

### Typical Nearground Locations
In the Nearground can be found brothels, seedy nightclubs, old-fashioned tea shops, non-Star Civilisation doctors who do not ask questions, black markets, drug dens, cheap hotels, Grav biker hang outs and burlesque clubs. 
The Hauler port is also normally by the Nearground. Some of the Hauler crews are seduced by the Nearground but most remain professional and once away from their Hauler, travel to the higher areas of the City.

### Star Enforcers and the Nearground
The Nearground is very difficult for the Star Enforcers to operate in. It can be very difficult to gather evidence of a crime as the anarchists refuse to co-operate and buildings rarely carry sensors. The Star Enforcers often return from the Nearground empty handed. The main exception is with particularly dangerous criminals, for which the Star Enforcers travel in great numbers and force.

## The Mesh
The superstructure of the Mex buildings contains large air ducts and utility sections, this area is known as the Mesh. The ducts of the Mesh run everywhere throughout the Mex City. Some longer ducts run the vertical length of the 2km building. Although originally intended for repair crews to work without disturbing the general public, the Mesh has now become home to an outcast part of society, the Meshrunners.

The Mesh can also be found in Orbitals and some very large spacecraft. The Mesh could be anywhere, so the same rules apply. The General Public are mostly ignorant of Meshrunners, assuming that the thieves and muggers come up from the Nearground in lifts.

### Meshrunners
Meshrunners live in the Mesh, leaving only to steal food and money from the general public. The Mesh is a haven for those on the run from society. Most Meshrunners are children, teenagers and young adults; petty criminals, family outcasts or escapees from the constricts of their upbringing. As Meshrunners grow into adulthood, they usually leave the Mesh for the bright lights and opportunity of the Nearground - or even back into society. Few grow old in the Mesh and even fewer are born there.

### Meshrunner Gangs
The Meshrunner Gang is a family. A tight knit group where  seniority is defined by time spent in the Mesh and ability; age is of little importance. Meshrunner Gangs tend to occupy an area of Mesh and rarely stray from their patch. A Gang's area is normally across many buildings over a few levels. Friction and suspicion between Gangs is great - each Gang assumes the others are in league with the Star Enforcers, their parents or whichever organisation they are avoiding.

### Running the Mesh
Moving through the Mesh is a Skill (Meshrunning) that can only be taught by another Meshrunner. Meshrunners use high tech climbing gear repurposed from common day items that can be hidden under clothing for when they are moving amongst the general public. Running the Mesh is extremely dangerous for the uninitiated as the Mesh is utterly dark and there can be sudden 2km vertical shafts. An experienced Meshrunner will know their Gang's Mesh extremely well and be able to navigate it with only the faintest glow of light.

### Becoming a Meshrunner
Meshrunners are always on the lookout for vulnerable children and teenagers. In most cases, these runaways end up in the Nearground and are unable to fend for themselves. Too young to work and susceptible to exploitation, Meshrunners offer the young outcasts a family life without any of the hassle. Some outcasts hear of the Mesh and go in search of it, which can be dangerous and difficult.

### The Star Enforcers and the Mesh
The Star Enforcers would like the Mesh to be empty save for repair crews. In most cases, the Meshrunners do not draw any attention as their thefts tend to be small and based on subsistence. The Star Enforcers normally leave the Mesh alone as the time and energy spent rounding up Meshrunners is better spent elsewhere. Furthermore, proving a Meshrunner has performed a crime is difficult and the sentences are so short for the petty crimes that they would just return to the Mesh afterwards. Star Civilisation believe that a Meshrunner left uncaught is more likely to return to civilised society than one that is caught and punished.

Only when Meshrunners become a problem do the Star Enforcers get involved. The Star Enforcer Investigation branch have a number of Mesh teams. These are specially trained  and equipped bionic Star Enforcers who can move through the Mesh with great speed. It is rare that these teams are brought in to solve a Meshrunner problem. In very extreme cases, the Mesh of a building can be closed down entirely, suffocating all those within. This extreme measure has only been taken once or twice in living memory.

### Using Meshrunners
Player Characters are normally ex-Meshrunners - people who have the Skills but do not run the Mesh anymore. Meshrunning Skills replace the standard Skills of a person's upbringing (using Gaia, mathematics, science, social understanding) so it is not to be taken lightly. Meshrunners are not included in this book as a Character class as they fit into a very specific sort of campaign setting.

Meshrunners make useful contacts, although Meshrunners are wary of anyone outside of the Mesh. Trust must be gained first before a Meshrunner will do any work for a player Character. 

Once trust is gained, a Meshrunner is very useful - able to steal, overhear and rob people before blending back into society. Meshrunners do not use Gaia, so contacting them can be difficult and gaining one as a valuable contact is likely to be a haphazard affair involved in a chance encounter.

## Scanning and Privacy
Scanning is the name given to using sensors to detect things that might be hidden from view. Sensors are fitted to buildings, spacecraft, vehicles (such as FEMTS) and anywhere where you want to ensure a level of security. There are two kinds of scanner: Tech scanners and Medical Scanners. A Tech Scanner analyses any piece of technology (weapons, bionic system, Automatons etc). 

A Medical Scanner scans biological life forms and is used for detecting a biological problem (diseases, illnesses, breaks, viruses etc). 

Scanners have levels of scan, the higher the level the more information provided. High level scans tend to take longer and need more power (and thus tend to be bigger). Details on the scanner levels can be found in Scanners on page 83.
Privacy

The Imperium guards the privacy of its citizens very carefully and as such, scanner use across Human Occupied Space is limited. Some colonies will ban any Technology scanning at all whereas more paranoid colonies will have invasive Tech and Med scanners (Level 2) everywhere. 

Most colonies will only have scanners where security is particularly important, such as in armouries or in Council buildings. Large corporations avoid using scanners, instead hiring humans augmented with bionics as their security teams to spot concealed weapons. It is not a fool-proof system but the Imperium would not allow a proliferation of scanning and the inevitable erosion of the right to privacy.

## Colony Travel
- A Prosurface colony spreads across and above the planets surface. There are common elements on every Colony (see picture).  
- A. Large spacecraft that cannot enter the atmosphere either dock to an Orb (or Orbital) from where they can undock and Light Jump to other systems. 
- B. Cargo is transported from orbit using Pitlifters, which are specifically designed to make the journey between orbit and planet surface. 
- C and E. For spacecraft that can enter atmosphere, they dock either straight onto the Mex City (C) or the Croft (E).  The Croft would have to have a very large output to warrant a freighter going straight there. Some Crofts have  their own Pitlifters.
- D. Cargo and people are transported between surface dwellings by high speed Haulers and sub orbital flyers (not shown). 

# Time
When the first spacefarers left Earth, they abandoned the 24 hour clock in favour of a 40 hour day. As ships always needed to have a crew awake and active, a ship system was developed that was soon adopted as the normal for the whole galaxy. The days is split into four 10 hour cycles. Each cycle serves a different purpose. Between each cycle is a meal.

### Sleep Cycle
During the cycle, a person get their rest. A human of 92030 only requires 9 hours sleep in 40 to function properly. The other hour is spent waking up and having the first meal called 'Breakfast'.

### Work Cycle One
This is the first ten hours of work. Some take two jobs, each with a 10 hour duration. After this cycle is a meal called 'Lunch'.

### Work Cycle Two
The second work cycle is normally a more relaxed affair as motivation begins to wane. After this cycle is the meal called 'Dinner'.

### Recreation Cycle
The recreation cycle is when a person can pursue whatever activities they are interested in. Most people have a hobby of some such. Before sleeping once more, a person normally partakes in a nutrient drink called a 'Cap'.
As everyone is living in a synchronised 40 hour lifestyle, businesses stay open for all 40 hours. People tend to share jobs, one job between two. The passing of day and night has no effect on the cycles of a person, phrases such as 'morning' and 'afternoon' are normally used to express the position of the sun in the sky. 

### Organisation of Years and Dates
Following the standardisation of time, dates and years followed suit. The organisation is as follows:

- Minute: 60 seconds.
- Hour: 60 minutes.
- Cycle: 10 hours.
- Day: 4 cycles (40 hours).
- Week: 10 days.
- Month: 4 weeks (40 days).
- Year: 10 months (400 days).

The month names are the same as the Gregorian calendar, except November and December are omitted. Days are named as Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Moriusday (after the previous Emperor), Solday (named after the system that bore the human race) and Thousanday (after the space station that became the cradle of human civilisation). Naming of the days has become unimportant as there is no weekend as such - people spend 10 hours of recreation every day. People simply refer to the date.

### Public Holidays
Although business runs 40x40, regardless of day and night, there are still public holidays. Days during the week are not taken off and there is no 'weekend'. The public holidays tend to mark events throughout Human Occupied Space (Empress' Birthday) or locally (Cluster or System Founding day). Public holidays depend very much on the system. Those systems without much local history tend to have fewer, as do heavily industrial systems. Artistic colonies and those systems with a long history tend to have more public holidays.

The Star Chambers do not partake in public holidays as the employees are always on duty. In some cases, they take part but only in an official capacity. The only exception to this rule is the Empress' Birthday when most Star Chambers throw a party. Only those on active duty do not. 

### Day and Night
The connection with time and night and day is no longer important. Very few planets have 40 hour day and the human race has got used to sleeping at the end of the 30 hours, rather than when it gets dark. This is especially important on planets where there isn't much night due to the light from large moons or on Orbitals, where day and night are simulated by glowing lights.

### Money
The Imperium has one single currency, the Imperial Credit (or just Credit). Money value and flow is controlled by the Imperial Resource Chamber. There are no banks, you cannot get a loan and money is stored on small plastic cards, on a Gaiacard or in a person's personal Gaia space (see section on Gaia).

No frills living in Icar is cheap. A cheap yet comfortable apartment can be rented for 100 credits a month and healthy meals cost as little 3 credits. A general price list is included in the Appendix (see the General Items Price List on page 161). Weapons, ammunition and armour are all relatively expensive as the Imperium believes that people should not need to buy them.

The Imperium raises taxes only through businesses. Corporations hand the Imperium a percentage of their revenue (not profit) automatically when doing business. It is possible for a Corporation to avoid paying tax but it is not advised as the Imperium will seize all assets immediately upon discovery, anyone found running a business this way will go straight to jail. Small time operations are ignored, which fosters the spirit of entrepreneurship.

All private banking (loans, interest on savings etc) is strictly forbidden and there is no stock market. Loan sharks do exist but are not used by the general populace. Interest rates from Loan sharks are extremely high and failure to pay can be deadly. Some colonies use their own currency but it is often for very ceremonial or tourist industries.

# Space Stations
With the advent of powerful interstellar Light Jump engines, it became obvious that spacecraft could be made very large indeed. However, the amount of energy required to get these huge craft from orbit to surface and back was greater than could be produced with legal technology. One solution to this was to have a place in orbit where a craft could deposit some of its cargo for shuttling down to the surface. This is the prime reason for having an Orbital space station but they are integral to the economy.

More than just trade platforms or orbiting store rooms, an Orbital is often the gateway to the rest of Human Occupied Space. They are used for many different tasks such as acting as: a base of operations for a mining company, a dock for spacecraft repairs and the home for many people who dislike living on planet. The use of an orbital often changes focus through its life, normally beginning as a trade or base of mining operation and then growing with the population to become a more pleasant habitation or supporting large trade ships.

## Space Station Types
Each Orbital is different from the others, however they do roughly split into two types: Orbitals and Orbs. 'Orbitals' is the name given to most orbiting space stations. They come in all shapes and sizes: sketch any design onto a piece of paper and that shape will be found somewhere in the Galaxy. 'Orbs' are space stations where an artificial world is created on the inside of a sphere.

## Orbitals
Orbitals are common across the galaxy and come in bewildering variety of shapes and sizes. Some Orbitals begin life as a freighter, stranded in orbit by a loss of Light Jump capability. These Orbitals tend to be expanded in a piecemeal manner and tend to look light huge pieces of orbiting space junk. Other Orbitals are designed from the outset and like Spacecraft are a mix of sharp lines and organic curves.

Orbitals can house up to 2 billion people and the largest Orbitals (which rival Orbs in size) are 1000km at their widest. The haphazard structure of most Orbitals requires artificial gravity to be present everywhere. Those unfamiliar with an Orbital would find that the direction of the Gravity can often change, meaning shopping districts around the inside of a cylinder.

### Transport in an Orbital
Getting around in an Orbital can either be done on foot, by driving a Grav or by FEMTS. Most people live close to where they work, shop and relax and so go by foot. This means than an Orbital tends to split into communities of people, not too dissimilar to Crofts on a planet's surface. 

When driving a Grav, they are driven through huge tubes that run to most corners of the Orbital. These tubes are often irregular and connect areas of the orbital that are important. The FEMTS system also uses its own set of tubes, exactly resembling the FEMTS of Mex Cities.

### Psychological effects of living in an Orbital
People who live in Orbitals tend to prefer enclosed spaces and can be agoraphobic (afraid of open spaces). Families that have lived on Orbitals for generations tend to be pale skinned and fair haired and are fiercely proud of their origin. Orbital inhabitants will have no problem with sharply changing gravity gradients and often make excellent Spacecraft crews.

### The Orbital Explained
This image shows a simple example of a common orbital with the main sections marked out. The Orbital is drawn in orbit with the planet below it. The top of the Orbital picture is the part furthest from the planet surface.

- A. The largest spacecraft dock onto 'foils' furthest from the centre. The most expensive external docking sections are at the top of the Orbital as it nearest to where spacecraft jump to.
- B. Freighters can also dock on the upper reaches of an Orbital but this is normally only for short stays and rapid unloads. Normally executive and courier spacecraft dock on the upper reaches.
- C. Every Orbital has at least one artificial biosphere where plants, trees, grass and wild animals live in a carefully balanced ecosystem. Expensive restaurants and apartments look out over the biosphere and most have public paths.
- D. The ubiquitous Free Mass Transportation System (FEMTS) travels up and down inside the docking foils transporting people back and forth to freighters. Private Grav cars and bikes also travel up and down but rarely Haulers. Automaton Hoppers are used for moving space crates.
- E. The main living space is crisscrossed with tubes that carry traffic. Smaller tubes (not shown) stretch out from the main tubes like veins, reaching throughout the superstructure.
- F. Pitlifter shuttles travel back and forth between planet surface and the Orbital. The Pitlifter always docks internally and near the living space.
- G. Internal space crate storage is expensive and normally only used by families, small businesses and spacecraft repair companies.
- H. Spacecraft less than 2km in length can be accommodated in internal docking bays. This main reason to do this is for performing repairs in low-gravity atmosphere.
- I. Most space crates carrying large quantities of raw materials (which are cubes 10m to a side) are stored external on a docking foil. If tens of thousands of space crates are to be loaded or unloaded, then spacecraft are often docked onto this foil and are serviced by a huge swarm of Automaton Hoppers.
- J. Engineering is where the Generators, Grav Engine, Grav Field Generators are located. It is the hub of repair and refurbishment, populated by enthusiasts under the pay of the Orbital. Engineering is off limits to the general public.

## Orbs
An Orb is the largest construction the human race has ever made. The Orb is an inside-out planet. A huge hollow sphere where the people live on the inside. The inside surface of the Orb is often as large as a large moon and contains continents, mountains and oceans. A huge artificial and yet self-sufficient ecosystem exists on the inside of these massive structures. Gravity is produced by localised Grav field generators, making sure the inhabitants have a constant gravity downwards, keeping them on the inside of the sphere. The atmosphere is created and maintained by a series of atmosphere processing plants that exhaust through the oceans. 

To give the inside a feeling of a planet, a huge light source (which is given a different name on each Orb, commonly known as The Solar) with a hood rotates in two axis in the middle of the Orb. This gives the appearance of light and dark. When looking 'up' on the Orb, you see the ground on the other side. During the day, the sun obscures the dark side of the world and the atmosphere gives a pleasant blue haze. Looking 'up' at night time, you will see a blue blur, without stars as if a moon was lighting high cloud.

The Orb is so large that the curvature of the surface is barely recognisable unless it is a clear day. Most people's day to day lives can be lead without ever realising they were not on a planet. Under the crust of the inner surface is a huge number of manufacturing bays and zero-g workshops. Massive transit tubes take FEMTS all over the orb.

### Orb Segments
An orb is made up of a huge number of triangular segments. Each segment has a very similar make-up. The diagram shows a cross section of the Orb. Transit tubes are used for moving around, although communities are created much like normal cities, towns and villages on any other planet. They are huge tube highways that curve throughout the structure of the Orb.
Most people live in cities, towns and villages on the inside and commute to the outer skin. 

### Social Considerations
Due to an Orb's size, there is more than enough room for everyone to live on the surface, regardless where they actually work. On a few desirably located Orbs, space can be at a premium and one can own a share of the surface. This makes the Orb much like any other planet, with large Mex cities for convenience and then out-of-the-way places of beauty for the rich.

### Psychological effects of living in an Orb
Unlike on an Orbital, the inhabitants of an Orb are unlikely to become agoraphobic (fear of open spaces) as the surface provides a wide-open space, akin to a planet. Claustrophobia (fear of closed in spaces) is also unlikely as the human subconscious knows that it is on the inside of a giant marble. 

Where Orb dwellers have problems is with Convexophobia. Convexophobia is the irrational fear of slipping off a planet's surface. In an Orb, the ground curves up at the horizon (concave), giving it a bowl shape. On a planet surface, the ground curves down at the horizon (convex), giving the appearance that things can slide off the side of the sphere.

### Orb Administration
Due to its size and general resemblance of a planet, an Orb always has its own administration and will have a councillor on the seat of the controlling planet of the system. In systems where an Orb has a larger population than the planet colony it orbits, the Orb will have a Council.

Charges for Orbs tend to be far lower than on an Orbital as there is so much more space. Also, they use a sliding scale. The longer you dock for, the cheaper it is. This sometimes leads to people abandoning craft on the Orb.

### Jungle Orbs
When The Droid War started, many people fled Orbs in search of a safer planet surface; the rational fear being that Orbs were easier to destroy than an entire planet. As such Droids often left Orbs alone - their ecosystems intact. Left unchecked the wildlife of the inside of the Orb would spread throughout the superstructure. These Jungle Orbs often do have people living on them but life can be difficult there as the flora and fauna constantly encroaches on crops.

Jungle Orbs are rare in Sayshell and most common in Remmar and the edges of Dorian. As Jungle Orbs are often the product of a rapid mass evacuation, they often contain treasures abandoned by those too preoccupied with Armageddon to think about what is being left behind.

### Orbai
The Orbai (pronounced Orb - eye) is the name given to the Artificially intelligent brain that controls the general running of the Orb. The Orbai is considered the same as the Artificial Intelligence on a spacecraft. The Orbai can be used as an information source for the inhabitants and normally has an avatar Automaton that represents it. 

The Orbai is very careful not to intrude into people's lives and only has sensors where it requires them for controlling the Orb. The Orbai is not allowed to go through Ascension and is capped at Artificial Intelligence Power 4 (see Artificial Intelligence Power on page 55).

### The Orb Explained
- A. Spacecraft less than 2km long can use the Radial Tunnels to enter the atmospheric area of the Orb. It is expensive to do so and not encouraged.
- B. The Solar gives the Orb a day and night cycle. Normally it's set to 12-14 hours. For clarity the diagram shows daytime across the Orb but in reality, the right hand half of the Orb would be shrouded in darkness half the time. The sun is powered centrally and hangs on Grav, unsupported by wires. It lets out a Sun-like UV balanced light. Orb dwellers often proudly declare that twilight and dawn on an Orb is more beautiful than any in nature.
- C. As the Orb is a fully functioning ecosystem, it also has clouds like any normal world. The atmosphere is regulated by carefully control plants and algae located under the seas. Orbs can be set up to be temperate, arid, cool or any combination of conditions.
- D. A Mex city. People live in Orbs much like any other colony. Very few people live anywhere other than the surface.
- E. Storage and heavy industry is found under the land mass, huge caverns that stretch for miles are organised entirely by an army of Automatons.
- F. Crofts. An Orb has the advantage of being self-supporting by growing its own food. Croft output tends to be very high as the environment can be controlled with great ease compared to a planet's surface.
- G. Radial Tunnels measure more than 5km in diameter and connect the outer skin to the inner atmosphere. They are used for spacecraft docking inside, service craft and pleasure trips.
- H. Every Orb uses seas to help regulate the environment and provide a source of sustainable food in the form of plants and fish. Early on in an Orb's life, it is the seas that provide while the land gains it nutrients.
- I. The area under the surface of the landmass is called the Hull. The hull is used for industry such as factories and raw material processing. Few people live in this area.
- J. The outer Hull is where the Orb generates its power, contains its generators and Grav systems to maintain orbit. Unlike Orbitals, Orbs have millions of smaller generators and always produces a great deal more power than it needs. It also provides a place for most spacecraft to dock.
- K. The Outer Skin is a 20km thick armoured metal skin, pock marked from years of meteorite impacts but tough enough to withstand collision with just about anything. Thousands of huge iris airlocks allow spacecraft through. Orbs are too large to have shields, so this thick skin is the only protection with space.

# Space Travel
Since mankind strode upright and gazed upon the night sky it has wondered what it would be like to visit the tiny points of light that hung overhead. Space Travel is commonly available though generally unused by the bulk of the populace. Space travel is either a requirement of work, a lifestyle or used for entertainment purposes. Purely recreational planet hopping is rare. The instability of the space-time continuum causes many dangerous places called Void Faults. Most are charted and can be avoided. Some can be detected from a distance (in time or space), others come and go at such speed, that the craft can be enveloped by them before they can be avoided.

Travelling in space will inherently involve a few calculations. To keep them simple, travel operates in multiples of an hour. There are many facts and figures scattered through this section. They are collated at the end for easy reference.

## How to read Sector maps
The Sector maps from Human Occupied Space can be found in the Appendix. The map below shows a portion of Remmar. Space is curved and not two dimensional so the maps are an approximation to reality.

- A. Cluster. The coloured blobs are clusters and the white between them are notional edges of those clusters. The nearer to red (or darker the grey) the Cluster is, the more colonies it has. A colony can number only 100 people, but it still counds.
- B. Named Cluster. Some of the maps have named Clusters. These named Clusters are described in this book. Only Anadar has a full description as it is the Cluster used in the included Scavenger Setting.
- C. The Zero Line. The Zero Line is a grey line that runs down the centre of the galactic arm. It represents 0 in the grid. 
- D. Rim 1. As an example, the horizontal line underneath 'D' is the first line towards the Rim.
- E. Spin line. The vertical lines are spin lines, and number 'up' from right to left. The spin lines are labelled along the bottom of the graph and are not shown here for simplicity.

## Using the Grid
The grid is used for finding Clusters. The horizontal lines are called either Hub or Rim lines. The lines above the white Zero Line are Hub lines. This is because if you carried on in that direction, you would head toward the centre of the galaxy. Horizontal lines below the Zero Line are Rim lines. This is because if you headed in that direction (down the page), you would be heading out of the galaxy. The Vertical Lines are Spin Lines and they number right to left.

To locate a Cluster, first find the nearest horizontal Hub or Rim line. If it sits between two lines, choose the line nearest the Zero Line and call it 'middle'. Next, you find the nearest vertical Spin line and if it sits between two, choose the lowest value and call it 'Middle'.

> For example, the Cluster labelled by 'A' sits between Rim lines 2 and 3. As the vertical Spin lines are not numbered on this example, assume its Spin line is 23. Therefore, the Cluster Location would be: Rim 2 Middle, Spin 23.

If the Cluster sits on the Zero Line, it's called 'Zero'. If it sits between the Zero Line and either Hub 1 or Rim 1, it is called Hub 0 Middle or Rim 0 Middle.

## Examples of Named Clusters
For more examples, here are the grid locations for all of the named Clusters. You can find the Sector Maps in the Appendix. The Sectors are included for ease but they are not required as the Spin lines will give you the Sector you are in.

### Remmar Sector
- Juno Cluster: Hub 1 Middle, Spin 22
- Tef Cluster: Rim 5 Middle, Spin 23
- Anadar: Hub 0 Middle, Spin 28
- Corisk: Zero, Spin 28
- Imperial Crescent: Hub 2, Spin 37

### Sayshell Sector
- Vitero: Rim 4, Spin 47
- Turus: Hub 1, Spin 41
- Romar: Hub 6, Spin 54
- Niopak: Hub 3, Spin 54 Middle
- Naggachef: Rim 2, Spin 56 Middle

### Dorian Sector
- Akar: Hub 4 Middle, Spin 69 Middle
- Baeleris: Rim 2, Spin 74

## Reading Cluster Maps
A Cluster map shows the locations of systems and other features within a Cluster. Cluster maps are based on a 20 sided grid. Each box on the Cluster map represents one Light Jump unit. In one hour, you can move up to as many squares on this map as you have Light Jump on your spacecraft. All jumps take at least one hour.

## Classifying Space
Before you can explore it, you need to know what you are dealing with. Space is classified depending on what is round it. Here are the main classifications of space:

- *Atmosphere*. Not strictly space as such but the first step one must make before getting there. Atmosphere is classed as the first 20km between the lowest point on the surface (sea level) and space.
- *Low Orbit*. Between 20km and 500km is low orbit. If a craft is not atmosphere capable, then this is the nearest to the surface it can get. Most large vessels use this altitude for the loading and unloading of cargo, although the expense of doing so is often prohibitive.
- *High Orbit*. From 500km to 1000km is known as High Orbit. This is where the Orbitals exist and where Point To Point Light Jumps can be performed from.
- *System Space*. Within the outermost planet's orbit around a star is system space. In a place with few planets, the edge of system space depends on the gravitational pull of the star.
- *Dead Space*. Dead space is the area that is not governed gravitationally by a star or its planets; the force provided by them is too weak to be useful to a non-Light Jump Grav engine. Most of space is dead space but you have to go a long way from a star to be in it.

## Jobs in space
Travellers are often grouped by the job that they perform. Most regular travellers through space operate as part of a crew on a star craft. Although the particular jobs on each craft are varied - from medic through to pilot - the crew are normally classified by the job that the ship does. A few examples of these tasks are given below.

### Imperial
The Imperium has 2 separate fleets. The largest Fleet is operated by the Star Enforcers and is used by Star Enforcers, Star Civilisation and Star Scientifica. The craft are mostly used for chasing criminals and for dealing with Pirates. Not all of the Enforcer fleet is well armed and are a mix of purpose built and converted civilian craft. The other fleet, The Star Fleet, is purpose built and created from the very best technology the Imperium has to offer. The crews are all Fleet personnel and represent a complete fighting force from fighter pilots to soldiers (called Troopers).

### Trade
In this case, the term Trade is a very broad one. A craft that moves any item from A to B is considered a trade one. A trade vessel carries freight (raw materials or tech) or passengers.  Typically, a depicts the type of cargo it caries. 
For example, Ore freighters tend to be large and dirty, with large industrial automaton equipment. Tech traders tend to be smaller, high tech craft! The dynamics of space trade itself is dealt with later.

### Courier
A courier picks up an item from one client and delivers it to another. They are more expensive than traders but give a more personalised hand-to-hand service: important for expensive or personal items. A courier is a regular space traveller and will build up a clientele of corporate and non-corporate customers. Excellent service will build a good name and this is essential for a successful courier.

### Deep Space Scavenger Crew
There are billions of tonnes of abandoned treasure, and junk worth money. A Deep Space Scavenger's (Scavengers) job is to find, repair and return for sale. Seen as the lowest of the low when it comes to ship crews, Scavengers spend their time in dangerous wrecks, hunting out cargo and objects of value. 

Within these floating shipwrecks could be any manner of dangers, from traps rigged by paranoid crew members on leaving the wreck to other Scavenger teams. The example setting pits you as one of these crews. See Scavenger Setting on page 97.

## Cost of Space Travel
Space Travel is cheap and available to the masses. There are nearly always spacecraft berths available, although it can be difficult finding a spacecraft on a direct route. In most cases, the traveller will change at a large terminus Orbital. Costs of travel do change with location, the numbers given here are for a typical colony.

### Buying your own Spacecraft
Brand new spacecraft are very expensive and the Imperium has outlawed loans. How you get hold of a spacecraft depends on what it is going to be used for. The most popular ways of getting hold of a spacecraft are (most expensive first):
- *Buy new from the manufacturer*. Spacecraft can cost millions, so this is only for large corporations or the super rich.
- *Buying second hand from a corporation*. Spacecraft are still expensive at 50% of the new price but for small corporations, this is often the best way.
- *Operate a Spacecraft for a Trade Company*. Trade Companies loan spacecraft to crews and require a minimum amount of return each month. The better the craft on loan, the more return required.
- *Buy a junker*. The best entry level spacecraft is an old refurbished  junker. These spacecraft come with only the basics but can be bought for as little as 25 000. Of course, you might spend a lot of time repairing the junker and it will not be as fast as a new craft but it will get you about.

## The Starbus
The Starbus a public transport network that connects major systems and clusters together. It acts as slow, reliable and cheap transportation through the void. Starbuses are huge spacecraft that are more like permanently moving villages than spacecraft. As such the Starbus self-organises by wealth with the rich and poor being entertained in different areas. The Starbus is so large that they never go down to the surface of the planet but instead are served by Pitlifter shuttle craft (many have their own). 

Every Starbus has a limited number of berths that are set aside for free travel. The births are communal and cramp but the atmosphere is fun and free. Most Star Buses cap the time you can spent in a communal bunk to 1 month but this is rarely checked and it is common for some people to live for their whole lives in Communal bunks.

The Starbus also carries cargo but it tends to be the personal items owned by passengers.

### Starbus Naturals
Starbus Naturals is the name given to people who permanently stay on a Starbus, using it as a means to see the Galaxy. A Starbus's route often rarely circles back on the same system, it is a good way to see lots of different places. Naturals are considered part of the crew and family, although they serve no function but to pay their way.

### Costs and Durations
The Starbus is a great deal slower than chartering your own spacecraft. The table below shows the costs and durations for different berths on the Starbus. Communal berths are free and cramps, a single room sleeps just one person, a suite is much larger and can sleep up to 4 - with a squeeze. Planetary travel is between planet orbits, Orbs and Orbitals. System travel is between two systems in the same cluster. Cluster travel is between two clusters. Intersector travel is not listed because the Starbus would take many months to cross into another Sector. If you want to change Sector, your best bet is to charter. For the price list see Travel - Star Bus on page 161.

## Spaceflight Types
Faster than light travel has been a goal of the human race since the laws of physics made the speed of light a boundary. In normal space, it is a boundary but there is more to the space-time continuum than just normal space. This section will stay as free from science as possible. Every trans-light vehicle is given a Light Jump speed. This speed is the number of boxes on a cluster map the craft can go in 1 hour. A cluster is approximately 20 squares in diameter. Use this a rule of thumb for unknown clusters or the actual cluster pictures for use.

### Grav
When travelling between ground, space and between planets in a system, Grav is used. Grav works by 'surfing' down the waves created by celestial objects (stars, planets and moons). With Grav, it takes approximately 1 hour to travel between planets, 10 minutes between a planet and a moon. These figures are ship-independent as the waves that the Grav surfs on are the same for all the different craft. The time from low orbit to planet (or vice versa) depends on the power of the Grav engine and varies from ship to ship. It's normally about 4 hours. The time between Low and High Orbit is small and thus can be ignored.
Grav suffers from zero gravity deficiency. This means that if the Grav engine is in a place where the gravities of objects around it cancel out. This dead zone is rare and is unlikely to last for very long but will cause the Grav ship to be stranded.

### Light Jump
A Light Jump is a method of traversing a huge distance of space in a fixed amount of time. A jump lasts one hour. At the end of which, you can jump again. The jump is in a straight line (there is no such thing as a straight line as space is curved, but simplified for ease here). All jumps last one hour, the faster the ship is, the further you go. This is because the ship takes most of this hour to accelerate and the major part of the travelling is done in the last ten seconds. Thus, if a ship can go at 20 and needs only to jump 10, it will still take an hour. All of the calculations required to cover long distances are performed by an AI and thus the crew of the ship can rest or perform other tasks while the vessel is in transit.

For a Light Jump engine to form a bubble in which to jump, it needs to be in a gravitational low. This means away from any system or large celestial objects and clear of other craft (by 1 minute). 1 hour outside of system space is typical. Thus, a Light Jump can only be performed in dead space. This is a pain because you need to travel to the edge of the system before you can leave.

Light Jumps are susceptible to space-time faults. A ship is likely to come out of jump immediately when encountering one - requiring the vessel to make another jump. It is uncommon that any damage will be done to the Light Jump engine unless it is old or already damaged.

> TIP: Light Jumps of this kind are old-fashioned and rarely found on modern craft. Most craft use Point to Point Light Jumps (given below).

### Point to Point Light Jump
The original Light Jump engine design is millennia old. The Point to Point Light Jump engine (PTP) takes sensor information, an improved star chart and more accurate engine for precise jumps. The PTP is very much like its old variant, except for two major points:

1. PTP can begin a jump from high orbit, as long as it is clear of any Orbitals.
2. PTP can end a jump within system space of another system but may not jump straight into high orbit.

PTP requires more power, and cannot be fitted on very large craft. For large craft with PTP, the engine and generators for it take up most of the vessel. PTP is mostly found in small executive and charter vessels (as might be used by couriers in a hurry). PTP is also four times as expensive. This is not so much the future of space travel, more of an alternative present.

### Curve Surf Engine
Rumoured to be invented by a number of rogue Star Sci scientists, the curve surf engine has unofficially been used by the Star Fleet for a few thousands of years. Curve Surf is a technology more like Grav than Light Jumping. Like Grav, it surfs down the gravity supplied by celestial objects, it does this beyond the speed of light. Because of the gradual acceleration offered by this surfing, the light jump bubble can be kept open indefinitely. A vessel using Curve Surf can also change direction in mid jump. 

As curve surf has a more accurate sensor pack and can change direction, it is less susceptible to time-space faults. Also, Curve Surfing can begin from anywhere in System Space.

The largest difference between Curve Surf and typical Light Jump Engines is that the speed of Curve Surf depends on the pilot. In Light Jump Engines, it does not matter what part of space you're flying through, the distance you travel given in one hour has a maximum. Curve Surf depends on the ability of the pilot to intelligent plot routes through space. This can be achieved by an AI, but the nuances of space an human flair will always achieve better results. Thus, for each ship equipped with Curve Surf, two light jump speed are provided: one if a Pilot Cruiser Skill check is successful and one if it is not. 

> For example, The Gaterunner is equipped with two engines, a Curve Surf (CS) and a Point to Point (PTP). You can choose to use either. They are listed as: CS: 8,16 / PTP:12. Use the PTP and you go 12. However, if you use the Curve Surf and pass your Skill check, you can go 16! Or if you fail, you only go at 8.

Curve Surf is expensive. Most engines are created specifically for a vessel and that vessel is likely to have a very powerful set of generators. Few craft are produced with a curve surf engine although it is possible to find an engineer (Street Deal with Taxing difficulty) to build a custom one. The cost of such an engine and upgrade will be approximately the cost of the space craft when it was new.

### Typical Craft Systems
Spacecraft vary in technology widely from the basic freighter to the most expensive executive cruiser. There are some basic systems that are found on most craft. 

_Typical Craft Systems_

| System | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Hull | Able to withstand the shock of meteor collisions. |
| Generators | Huge power sources from which all power on the craft derives. Spacecraft do not use fuel, all their power comes from the Generators. |
| Life Support | Air and food processing for indefinite survival (they have their own generators). |
| Grav Engines | Engines use the Gravity of nearby objects to move around. A Grav engine is used for sub-light travel between planets in a system. |
| Light Jump Engines | Engines used for moving between systems and clusters. |
| Energy Web | The power distribution system around the craft. |
| Sensors | Mostly used for detection of collisions and for avoiding space-time faults. |
| Grav Field Generator | Creates an artificial gravity on the ship. Can be localised to allow any surface to be walked on. |
| Grav Lock | A device for keeping the atmosphere 'in' where the hull has holes (airlocks and breeches). |
| Shields | An energy based defence that can be turned on and off. Invisible to the human eye. |
| Cargo Bay | A space for stacking crates. |

## Dangers in Space
Space is a dangerous place. It's no wonder that most of the human population prefer to stay put. Most of the problems that occur in space are more of an irritation (costly to those who use space for business) than a risk to life. It is, however, unpredictable. This section deals with some of the problems that can occur, they are either space-time faults or not.

When everything has gone wrong then there are services operating within Human Occupied Space that can save you. The Star Enforcers will send help if there are any craft nearby but you will not be a priority. There is also the private corporation Void Rescue on page 64).

### Quantum Singularities
A quantum singularity is the scientific name given to things that are inexplicable, unpredictable and really quite dangerous. They can arise without warning, be difficult to sense and can have a number of effects on a star craft:

- *Drop out of light jump.* Can be caused by the singularity draining power from the generators momentarily or similar energy 'blip'.
- *Incorrect Sensor Readings.* Either echoes from times past or reversed sensor information is another often occurrence with singularities. The sensor information of a planet may momentarily pop up in the path of ship (causing a drop out of light jump).
- *Weirdness.* Alterations in gravity on ship, atmosphere conditions or the biological state of the crew are all part of deep space weirdness.
- *Total Energy Shut Down.* Perhaps the worst-case scenario, this would involve the main generators shutting down completely. Restarting generators can often take days.

### Worm Holes
These are tunnels that connect different places in the space-time continuum. They exist for spaces of time and are then gone. Some do re-occur, but those are not dangerous: they are listed amongst the star charts as avoids. If a light jump takes a craft through a worm-hole then the position of the craft in space and time can be somewhat random. There is a 50/50 chance that a Light Jump Engine will come out of light jump before entering the worm-hole, in this case, it can be avoided.

Worm holes are not to be entered, they are extremely dangerous and a craft must be specially designed to cope with the huge pressures and energy flux within the tunnel.

### Energy Ripples
When a celestial event occurs (such as a star exploding - a super nova) then a huge sphere of ripples spreads out, leaving very little where the star once was. When this occurs, huge ripples of energy are left travelling, getting weaker as they spread. However, there are areas where they may gain energy and when this occurs they can become dangerous once more.

The least a ripple will do is drop a craft out of light jump. With more powerful ripples, the ship may be push off course and damaged as well. The worst an energy ripple can do is to carry the ship through the light jump net into the lone systems and cripple it. 

### Asteroid Fields
When celestial objects explode, they leave debris. Unless there is some sort of a gravitational field to do this, they will remain in rings and spheres. In most areas of space, these are charted, but they can move and the detonation of stars can cause their satellites to become asteroid fields.

The worst a field can do is drop the craft out of light jump. If the field is large enough to do damage to the vessel, then it will be detected early on.

### Super-Dense Nebulae
A nebula is a huge cloud of gas. Most nebulae are harmless, the major bodies within it mapped out such that travellers may not have a collision. Dense nebulae are more dangerous as they hold stars being born. The energy involved in such a process can cause energy ripples (see above).

### Astrofailure
This is the name given to any fault or failure within the craft. This can occur of very old vessels. Most vehicles have an AI which can scan for problems within the ship. However, the difficulty is not always detecting the problem, but solving it.

Total energy loss is the worse case scenario. If the generators shut down then there is no power to go anywhere and help must be summoned. 

### Gravity Nulls
A Gravity null is a point in space where the gravity pull of surrounding stars cancel out. This is a problem for Grav engines and Light Jump engines because they all require a Gravity source to push or pull against.

If you find yourself in a gravity null, you could be stuck there for minutes, hours, days or years.  Gravity nulls can be both predictable (listed in Star charts and avoided) and unpredictable. They can pulse on and off and some are even used by pirates, who lie in wait for a spacecraft to come to a halt.

### Pirates
Uncommon in Dorian, common in Remmar and impossibly unlikely in Sayshell, pirates are those people with armed craft that attack other craft. Depending on their motives and the Captain, the pirates may just take the cargo or murder the crew as well. They normally choose soft targets (or those that look soft). Most pirates are well organised and educated, researching their targets and finding fences for the cargo before attacking. It is often thought that Pirates are amongst the best-trained ship crews.

## The Dynamics of Trade
Trade is the movement of resources from one system to another for money and happens for three reasons. 

Firstly, trade occurs because a system requires a certain resource to continue operating. For example, a sub-surface colony may need a supply of oxygen. This is called an obliged trade route. Failure to complete this route can mean a fine and even a banning of spacecraft use. Often, if the trade route does not appear profitable enough, then the Councils it serves will add a subsidy; after all, the welfare of the system is at stake.

Secondly, a trade route may exist between two planets where there is mutual benefit. In one direction there may be flow of food and water from an inhabited planet and in the other direction technology from a planet strong on manufacture. These routes are controlled by the Councils on the planets and are sold to particular traders to operate them. No one else may run that cargo on that route unless there is an increase in demand. This is called a secured trade route.

Finally, a trade route between two systems where there is profit to be had. This is a more traditional route and they make up 80% of the total number of routes. These are called free trade routes.

## Space Travel Facts and Figures
- A Light Jump takes 1 Hour.
- A ship's light jump speed gives the number of cluster squares travelled in a single jump.
- A cluster can be considered to be 20 cluster squares across.
- A craft must be 1 hour outside the system (outermost planet) before it can light jump.
- On Grav, it takes 1 hour to travel between planets.
- On Grav, it takes 10 minutes to travel between a planet and a moon.
- Unless otherwise stated by the spacecraft sheet, it takes 4 hours to go from Low Orbit to the planet surface.
- From Low to High Orbit takes a very small amount of time and can be ignored.
