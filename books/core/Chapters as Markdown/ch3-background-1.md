# Overview
Icar is set in 92028 AD, an evolved human race is is spread along one arm of the Milky Way, ruled by a benevolent government called the Imperium. A second race of sentient robots called _The Droids_ are determined to eradicate its human creators - and would have succeeded if not for their own internal civil war. Humanity thrives and prospers while the Imperium's navy protects them from obliteration. 

Within Human Occupied Space, trade spacecraft jump between star systems; huge corporations mine, refine, build and expand; automated agriculture ensures food aplenty, planets are terraformed, enormous sphere space stations are built, people communicate instantly in the virtual copy of Gaia, and most live out a happy existence without fear or hunger and with enormous social freedom. Criminal syndicates work in the margins of society, avoiding the Imperium Star Enforcers and pursuing their own power struggles.

The following sections are a brief overview of each topic. You can find more detail on each topic later in the book.

## The Imperium
The Imperium is a benevolent organisation governed by an Empress and composed of _Chambers_ governing an aspect of humanity's development. Imperial Peers (Lords and Ladies) are given volumes of space to nurture. 

The Imperium's maintains security, order, social and scientific progress using military styled _Star Industries_. _Star Fleet_ is tasked with defending humanity from external threats, such as the Droids. _Star Scientifica_ makes sure research continues apace. _Star Civilisation_ looks after human welfare, education and medicine and the _Star Enforcers_ are the police. 

The Imperium uses an artificial intelligence called _The Nexus_ to act as impartial judge and managed disputes with the Star Industries and the other Imperial Chambers. The entire Imperium is driven by a civic duty to strive in the interests of the human race else the Droids would win and the human race would be lost.

Corporations, although driven by profit are not considered to be evil. They too have a civic duty to the human race, a fact the Imperium is quick to remind them of. There is a single currency, the Imperial Credit. Banking is illegal.

## Geography
Human Occupied Space is split into three Sectors and each Sector is split into a huge number of clusters. A cluster is a group of stars that geographically are nearby and have a shared economy. A system is a series of planets orbiting a single star. Most Icar campaigns will take place across one or two Clusters.

Most humans live in colonies. A colony is normally on or under a planet's surface and is built using a set of standard building blocks called Mex buildings. A Mex city is a large number of Mex buildings formed into a lattice. People also live on spacecraft (space ships) and in space stations, called Orbitals and Orbs.

## Technology
Travel between the stars is easy and cheap. Spacecraft are numerous and much of a colony's economy depends upon selling goods to other planets or systems.

Humanity communicates through Gaia, a virtual world that is a copy of the real world. Gaia is immersive with such accuracy that it can be indistinguishable from reality. Communication between two locations in Gaia is instantaneous, regardless of the real world distances involved. Gaia also contains astronomical data on all known star systems, and is used as a navigational aid aboard all spacecraft. Most people use their real world appearance in Gaia but the more avantgarde use any form or shape. Gaia is free to use in public holorooms but anyone one step up the social ladder will have a Gaiacard (mobile smart phone), which gives access anywhere, can store programs (called Entities) and information. You cannot be killed through Gaia.

The human race have created a secondary race of machines called Automatons. These intelligent machines differ from the Droids in that they are unable to cause harm to humans. Automatons can be found everywhere and in all shapes and sizes, from humanoid receptionists that are indistinguishable from humans to automated cargo haulers called 'Hoppers'. Every Automaton has an owner but there are those fighting for their rights to be considered as equals. Most humans have an uneasy distrust of Automatons, regardless of their proven safety.

## Humanity
The human race has evolved and as it did so, it split into different Genuses. Common humans are Genus 1. The Genus 2 mutation is a zombie-like race who are poisonous to the other Genus (these were the original target of the Droids). Genus 3 are a rare race of humans with 'psychic' powers. The Imperium does not recognise their existence publicly.

There are no major religions or superstitions. Humanity is split down philosophical lines: Humanists believe that natural evolution without technological interference. Technologists believe that the next evolutionary step is to merge with machines. Every colony - and human living there - will be somewhere on that spectrum; it's only when opposing limits of that spectrum struggle for dominance that trouble occurs. There is also a sub-culture called Akarakians who follow a philosophy that the end justifies the means. 

The human race commonly augments itself with technology and all birth defects can be rectified. Bionics include under-the-skin bionics called cyberware, limb-replacement bionics called borgware and minor genetic modification called bioweave. The greater the augmentation, the less society trusts or respects.

## Syndicates
Not everyone plays by the rules. The Imperial Nexus's exceptional information and resources, petty crime is easily solved. Crime syndicates are a reaction to the Nexus, highly organised groups of people that seek to gain power, make money or subvert society. Syndicates are either Humanist,  Technologist or local power brokers.

# The Galaxy
The Milky Way galaxy contains approximately two hundred billion stars. It is one hundred thousand light years in diameter and two thousand light years thick. The galaxy is populated by two dominant species. Only one hundred million of the stars in the Milky Way hold stable systems, the others are either engulfed in nebulae, have no useful planets or sit within the penumbra. Of these systems, approximately ten million are populated by one of two species. The first, holding 95% of known space is the race called 'Droids', hostile to the other 5%, which is an evolution of homo sapiens. Many sentient species of lower intelligence exist, but do not have a bearing on interstellar affairs. The galaxy is broken up into areas called Sectors.

The Galactic Divisions picture shows a plan view of the Milky Way. Volumes 1-13 are situated in the Morpheus Arm of the galaxy, this the vastly explored area of the Galaxy, occupied by Droids and humans alike. Around the edge of the arm are systems known as the Lone systems, a region of stars that are far enough apart to make travel slow; trade and defence unpractical. A small strip (about the thickness of the white line) that exists just outside human space is known as the Fringe, this is a unruly area of space. The humans class the Fringe as Lone systems. 

Volume 14 is the galactic core, an impassible mass of energy at the centre of the Milky Way. Volume 15 is the opposite galactic arm called the Hypnos Arm, which is largely and uncolonised due to the huge distances involved. 

The galaxy is split into two arms, the Morpheus Arm and the Hypnos Arm. The Morpheus Arm is the only one documented in Icar, so is split into sections called sectors. Within a sector, stars form in clumps called clusters. Around each star is a set of planets (stars without any planets tend to go unnoticed), a star and its planets are called a system. Only single star systems away from anomalies are considered for colonisation. For the sake of everyone's sanity, space is dealt with as being 2D. Furthermore, the curves and anomalies of space are not shown, although space travel does depend on them.

## Droid Space
Droid space is the name given to the huge volume of star systems that the Droids occupy. The Droids are an artificially intelligent race of xenophobic robots. Created by humanity to fight a war against a genetically poisonous genetic offshoot of humans. A flaw in their programming caused the Droids to turn on their creators, resulting in a massive loss of human life - leaving only 0.5% of the human race. Another flaw in their system was exploited by their creators and the Droids turned against each other. Droid space is split into factions, areas where the Droids have split into groups. At any one time there are approximately 5 million different factions. Every system in Droid space is utilised in the most optimum manner for the creation of more Droids.

The Droids are an extremely powerful race with incredible resources, if at any time the many factions joined together, then a concerted (and successful) effort may be made against humanity. Until this time, the Droid faction infighting makes them ineffective against the humans. Droids are organised by mark (type) and variant (version). Marks are numbers and variants are letters. A higher number doesn't suggest more powerful but a higher variant does.

Droids are extremely intelligent and will not give up until destroyed. They have the ability to reproduce themselves (given appropriate resources) and can tactically gauge very complex situations from a very objective point of view. Their concept of self-worth only exists to aid the completed mission. Droids will only sacrifice themselves if patience cannot yield more human kills. 

At the start of The Droid War, the Droids could program other machines to turn against their human masters. Since the advent of Gaia and the Gaia 2 programming language, Droids are unable to access any machines within human space. This has effectively made all vehicles and home-service Automatons safe from Droid reprogramming.

'Droid' is a specific name for this particular race of killing machines. Not all robots are Droids, only those programmed to kill are called Droids. More information on this distinction can be found in the Automatons section.

## Human Occupied Space
A small proportion of the Milky Way is controlled and inhabited by humans. The area of human Occupied Space (HOS) is split into three sectors: Sayshell, Dorian and Remmar. Humanity is in a post-war era of rebuilding and consolidation. All that separates the humans and Droids is an invisible light jump Net: A web that leeches energy from spacecraft travelling faster than the speed of light. While recharging, humans intercept and destroy the Droid spacecraft. Human Occupied Space is controlled by a benevolent organisation called The Imperium, without which chaos would reign and the Droids would surely invade and overwhelm.

# The Imperium
The Imperium is a benevolent empire that is the guardian of the human race. The Imperium consists of a set of Chambers, each overseeing a particular area of the Imperium's operation. Overall power is assigned to an Empress who is arbiter and leader. The core of the Imperium is a small organisation, employing only twenty thousand people. However, the Imperium has direct control of the Star Industries, military organisations under the control of The Imperium who are the real power. The Star Industries are Star Fleet, Star Scientifica, Star Enforcers and Star Civilisation

## The Imperial Chambers
The Imperial Chambers are the organisations within the Imperium that control the day-to-day running of humanity. The Imperial Chambers are filled with the brightest minds of the human race and number just three thousand. Each councillor has a menagerie of politicians, information brokers and analysts, indirectly on the pay roll but essential nevertheless.

### Imperial High Chamber
This Chamber is comprised of two eminent councilors from each of the other Chambers. The Chamber deals with Imperial policy and is chaired by the Empress. The Empress has final say about all matters but normally the best solution is hammered out long before this Chamber sits in a meeting.

### Imperial Civil Chamber
This Chamber deals with colonisation and matters of power imbalance within the three sectors. The Civil Chamber also deals with expansion and grants for existing systems. The Civil Chamber is by far the largest of the Chambers (at 300 personnel) and controls the majority of Imperial funds.

### Imperial Resource Chamber
The Resource Chamber controls the flow of money around the Galaxy. By controlling money, the control of inflation (which is unheard of) and the issuing of funds across the Imperium. This is similar to a 21st Century central bank but as there is no lending or other currencies, their job is considerably more simple.

### Imperial Star Chamber
This Chamber is made up from the heads of each of the Star Chambers. This Chamber allows each Star Industry (The Fleet, Enforcers, Scientifica and Civilisation) to vent their problems and help others to find solutions. The Empress sits as chair of this Chamber but rarely speaks.

### The Chamber of Imperial Peers
The Imperial Peers are the Imperial Lords and Ladies who nurture Clusters in Human Occupied Space. The Imperial Peers sit in session rarely, most disputes are settled calmly over Gaia. The Imperial Peers must sit in session together at least once per year, an event more to do with pageantry than political benefit.

## Benevolence
The Imperium is not corrupt as one might expect, they are benevolent to the core. It is understood throughout all the Chambers that their actions could save or destroy the human race. Any corruption is immediately rooted out in public. Such paranoia about corruption is seated deeply within The Imperium as the last time corruption was allowed to seep in, it lead to a massive inter-human war (The Aran War). Honour is key, no Imperial worker would dishonour themselves with corruption.

The Imperium is based in a crescent of systems in Remmar called The Imperial Crescent from where they gather information, hold festivals and allow people a place to voice their anxieties. The Imperial Crescent is a high tech and social model for the rest of the human race thats attracts tourists, businesses and the poor looking to build a better life.

## Star Fleet
Star Fleet is a spacecraft fleet that defend the human race against the Droids. The Fleet is split into three Commands: Battle Command, Support Command and Deep Space Command. Battle Command consists of all the spacecraft and warriors that do the fighting. Support Command deals with the logistics of keeping the Battle Command supplied and repaired. The secretive Deep Space Command is used for exploration, Recon and information gathering. They operate far outside of Human Occupied Space.

Star Fleet is equipped with the pinnacle of human technology to combat the Droids and has discovered tactics and methods for defeating them even when grossly outnumbered. Many of the spacecraft in the Fleet (ranging from massive hulks down to tiny skiffs) spend their time patrolling the light jump Nets which surround the edges of the sectors that border with the Droids, waiting for any spacecraft to be caught in the Net. Star Fleet's foot soldiers are a legion of power armoured knights called Troopers, a select few of which become highly trained Special Forces and the very best are made into the Elite. Troopers are not grunts, they are highly educated, trained and professional fighting force.

The Fleet is based in the Turus cluster in Sayshell and have vowed that Sayshell will never fall to the Droids. The public rarely sees Star Fleet except when broadcasted by the Gaian news programmes. Gritty battles remain unedited at the request of The Fleet. Colonies with a strong leisure community are chosen for leisure time for the crews. Troopers and pilots like to party and often take over bars, clubs and entire pleasure resorts. 

### Star Fleet and the general public
Civilian spacecraft Captains running expeditionary missions across the light jump Net will be scanned by Star Fleet as they re-enter Human Occupied Space. Although The Fleet is looking for the presence of Droids on board they will also scan for other illegal items but will hand the information to the Star Enforcers rather than spending time enforcing the law. The vast majority of the general public bear enormous respect for the members of The Fleet and appreciate the work that they do. It is common for a member of the public to approach a member of the Star Fleet and offer to buy them a drink, shake their hand or thank them.

## Star Scientifica
With colonies spread across such huge distances, scientific discoveries took many years to proliferate throughout humanity. Star Scientifica (Star Sci) was formed to be the centre of academic wisdom and research. Many of the great scientists flocked to be part of the Imperium funded research. 

Many of the areas of technology researched are kept away from the public and are released when it is deemed safe to do so. This is seen as 'saving the public from themselves' and has proved to be a very good idea. 

The general public will sporadically hear about corporations being presented with advanced technology or colonies being provided with a scientific solution to a global catastrophe. News stories regarding Star Sci are normally accompanied with raised eyebrows and a sigh of relief that they are on the human's side. Technology is always released very carefully to multiple organised to ensure that no single company can become a monopoly.

This gives Star Sci an image of secrecy, a feeding ground for conspiracy theorists and an equal sense of mistrust and awe from the general public.

### Organisation
Star Sci is organised by area of research. The research groups are known as the Elements and are split into Fire (pure theory), Earth (non-space application of pure theory), Air (biology, botany etc), Water (social sciences) and Void (anything to do with space). Specially chosen scientists from each of the Elements gather together at a Gaia space called The Quorum of Elements. Here they discuss problems and share major findings.

## Star Civilisation
When the last Emperor, Morius, died he left a list of jobs for his successor, Empress Eshkar. He believed they were vital. Star Civilisation (Star Civ) was on task and although new, its connection with Morius gave it instant respect. Star Civ is responsible for:

- Ensuring food, water and air for all
- Educating people over Gaia
- Providing health care
- Creating, fostering new colonies
- Protecting independent colonies
- Housing and caring for those in hardship
- Issuing licenses
- Supervising and supporting colonial councils
- Choosing new Imperial Peers

Although new, Star Civ is the second largest Star Industry (after the Star Enforcers) and has had a huge impact every human's life. Star Civ are pervasive throughout every facet of a human's life from the cradle to the grave. Inbetween those bookends they are helpful councillor and impartial public servants.

Few argue that the Imperium wants to control what people think and the best way to do this is to control the education of children. There is no evidence that the lessons taught changed with the arrival of Star Civ, children are actively encouraged to question the Imperium and all philosophical ideas are taught and accepted.

### Star Civ Healthcare
Doctors are paid a nominal salary by the Imperium for running clinics that look after patients. They can be found on all spacecraft and colonies in huge numbers. Although paid by Star Civ, their independence is guaranteed by the Imperium's privacy laws.

Star Civ also run trauma units where the badly wounded can be rescued by highly trained paramedics. The service is free but the patient is scanned. Star Civ Artificial Intelligences (AIs) can also assist over Gaia (+2 to Medicine skill check).

The downside of using Star Civ is that the Nexus is always watching and will use the information it gleans from your medical emergency as evidence for Star Enforcers. Be careful that you do not implicate the patient - or yourselves - in a crime by using it.

## Star Enforcers
The Star Enforcers are the police; keeping law and order on the majority of systems in Human Occupied Space. Smaller colonies and corporate installations fund their own security, although all legal judgements are still provided by the Nexus.

The Star Enforcers are split into four 'Divisions': Void, Investigation, Colonial and Justice. Void deals with the spacecraft and defends against pirates. Investigation deals with matters of interstellar importance (particularly dangerous criminals). Colonial is by far the largest of the divisions and includes all the police on colonies keeping law and order. The last division is justice system and hands out punishment depending on local laws. Most common are imprisonment on penal colonies, solitary confinement, bionic switch off, labour camps and even execution on a few colonies.

### Getting away with crime
As surveillance technology has advanced, so has the ability to fake evidence. Before a judgement can be made, the Nexus requires Enforcers to collect enormous amounts of evidence. The evidence must be corroborated and the Nexus will tell the investigators where the contradictions in the evidence lie and what additional evidence is required.

The only sure fire way of being immediately arrested and convicted is to perform a crime in front of a Star Enforcer. The more evidence the criminals leave over a series of criminal acts, the more likely the Nexus will request their arrest. Typical Criminal activities are listed in Typical Criminal Activities on XXXXXXX.

## Imperial Lords and Ladies
The Imperial Lords and Ladies (Imperial Peers) oversee the clusters of Human Occupied Space, directing their enormous wealth and resources to solve problems at the cluster level - across a number of systems. The peers themselves are figureheads of huge quasi-corporate organisations, whose wealth had accumulated before the start of the Droid War. 

Funding is part in some profitable activity and part from the Imperium. This funding primarily runs vast trade navies which perform unprofitable trade routes to ensure that colonies do not die out. The peers also use troubleshooter and investigation teams to quietly solve problems at the ground level; helping the colony help itself rather than simply applying the huge economy wealth of the peer.

Peers do not openly discuss their philosophical views (as either Humanist, Technologist or Akarakian) but they do influence their decisions. A Peer's philosophical belief is the topic of many bar conversations; the result of which is included with each description below.

### Lady Tess Cannar
Lady Cannar is a tough, unscrupulous Dorian Sector Peer. Her severe bobbed hair, pale pallor and slight build and austere clothing is as sharp as her wit. She is curt, brief and direct. When compassion is required for the populace, Lady Cannar transforms into a kind and caring maternal character. It is this convincing dual personality that experts find unsettling.

Before becoming a Peer, Lady Canner was the heiress of a large Dorian Trade Corporation but was more interested in people. Emperor Morius was taken by her 'People First' policies and made her an Imperial Peer at the age of 22. Humanist philosophy.

### Lord James Walker
Lord Walker is an upbeat, camp and flamboyant man with unashamedly advanced bioware. The general public are in love with and perplexed by him in equal measure. His bubbly outgoing personality and fast talking hyperbolic speeches hide a shrewd negotiator and businessman. His retinue forms a wake that creates a perpetual party and economic upturn.

Before becoming a Peer, Lord Walker was a wealthy experimental artisan and a household name in most of the clusters he now nurtures. In spite of his bioware, most believe him to be humanist.

### Lord Stephen Lawrence
Lord Lawrence is a proud and serious Peer who speaks softly but demands respect. He is a gentle man, who takes the time to listen to anyone who gives him their time to explain their problems. Lord Lawrence works tirelessly for his people and was once ordered to have a holiday from work by the Empress - a holiday he spent inspecting leisure facilities on one of his colonies. Lord Lawrence not a great economist, taking advice from a herd of advisers.

Before becoming a Peer, Lord Lawrence was a Star Fleet Stub Wing pilot, having served 25 years with the 2nd Stub Wing Fighter Squadron on the Star Clipper Relentless. Technologist philosophy.

### Lady Jacqueline Crowell
Lady Crowell is a young, energetic Peer who delights in asking difficult questions of those whom she meets. Lady Crowell is famous for learning all there is about a colony before she arrives. The unprepared are often embarrassed by the breadth of her knowledge and the depth of her questionning. 

Lady Crowell emerged as a candidate from one of Remmar's wealthy construction families, who inherited huge wealth while working in the Imperial Civil Chamber. Akarakian philosophy.

### Lady Berrinda
Lady Berrinda is as fierce as her reputation. A fiery Character who throws her power and weight behind causes she believes in. Lady Berrinda spends most of her time at fledgling colonies, bringing resources, trade routes and expertise. This usually accelerates the growth of a colony and a failure is rare.

Lady Berrinda came to Emperor Morius's attention when she led a fleet of 25 hulk freighters through 12 clusters of Droid space to safety. Having saved millions of lives, Lady Berrinda was ready to head back when she was force by Imperial decree to become a Peer. Legend has it that she flew into a rage and threw a chair through a stained glass window. Morius appeased her by giving her clusters along the light jump Net edge of Remmar Sector (the Typhon side), making her a patron of the Fringe. Technologist philosophy.

### Lady Axa Erland
Lady Erland is the Imperial Peer in charge of the Akarak Nation. Although appointed by the Empress, Lady Erland was drawn from the Akarakian Elders. Lady Erland is a typical Akarakian and strictly follows the three tenets of hard work, expansion of the mind and a pragmatic view that the end justifies the means. For more detail see Akarak Nation XXXX.

### Imperial Peer Trade Navies
The root of an Imperial Peer's power is a navy of freighters. These spacecraft are owned and operated by the Peer and serve colonies whose economies are too weak to support a regular trade links. As soon as a colony economy strengthens, the trade navy craft are moved on to assist other colonies.
 
Trade navies are resented by other trading outfits because they imbalance trade prices in the cluster in which they operate.

### Clusters and Peer Control
Most Clusters tend to stay under the control of the same Peer. However, the Peers can swap Clusters between them (as long as the general public vote in favour). Another method for changing Peer is when the Council of many systems in the Cluster vote against the Peer. This is uncommon and frowned upon by the Imperial Civil Chamber. Normally, the Cluster will only vote against the Peer if there has been a serious miscarriage of justice.

### Peer Creation
Peers are chosen from a shortlist (compiled by Star Civ) of wealthy industrialists by the Empress and the position is a double edged sword - it's a position of considerable power and influence but you cannot refuse if you are called upon to serve. Peers spend most of their time travelling between systems and as such do not have a seat of power. While en route between systems, business and problems are dealt with over Gaia. No-one has yet stopped being a Peer.

# Corporations
Corporations tread a fine line between exploiting colonies and providing for them. The law is broad enough to stop corporations from controlling colony politics. Corporations come in three sizes: Intersector, Intercluster and Local. Intersector corporations stretch across all of Human Occupied Space and include the biggest brands that have been around for tens of thousands of years. Intercluster Corporations tend to be localised amongst a few clusters in a single Sector. Local Corporations at the very most spread over only a single cluster. A list of well known and example corporations can be found XXXXXX.

## Black Mills
Most Local and few Intercluster Corporations fund secret 'Black Mill' subsidiaries to influence the markets, steal secrets from competitors, entice employees, and even cause damage to other companies. Although illegal, Black Mills have become expert in evading the Star Enforcers. Black Mills use the Undergaia to arrange missions, hire mercenaries and exchange private corporate data. In many cases they are indistinguishable from syndicates.

# The Sectors
The galactic arm is split into Sectors. Each sector began life as an administrative zone, which then grew into a place with an identity of its own. Since The Droid War, all but three sectors fell to the Droids. The Imperium built light jump Nets along the borders of each of the human occupied space sectors to stop the Droid ships just long enough for the Star Fleet to intercept.

The three sectors under human control are Sayshell, Dorian and Remmar. Sayshell is the home of Star Fleet and having never fallen to the Droids, it is the safest, wealthiest and most cultured sector. Dorian holds the reigns of production. Remmar, newly retaken from the Droids is the sector of expansion and new opportunities. Sectors can be further broken down into clusters.

Separating the sectors from the Fringe and Droid space is a light jump Net. This net will stop any craft light jumping through it in either direction. If a spacecraft light jumps though this one light-year thick barrier, it will be pulled out of its jump and all craft nearby (including Star Fleet) are automatically notified.

## The Anatomy of a Sector
A sector is represented as a flat map taken from above (looking down on the plane the galaxy spins in). A sector is made from a mosaic of clusters: groups of stars that due to their proximity share a common culture and economy. In ancient times, a cluster would be considered a nation. As you move away from the centre of the arm, the number of systems diminishes and clusters are spread far apart. light jumping spacecraft take longer to travel between stars in The Fringe and Lone Systems.

> CLUSTER PICTURE XXXX

The Central Arm: The central arm is the name given to the bright section running down the centre of the sector. System density is highest here.

Clusters: A line between each of the sections are the markings defining clusters. Those clusters that are dark have many stars (up to 30), the lighter have fewer (5). Detailed descriptions for the Anadar cluster is included in the Scavenger Setting on page XXXX.

The Fringe: The area outside the light jump Net is the top and bottom edges of the image. The exception to this is the white line, which shows the light jump Net.

The Lone Systems: Those systems on the very edge of the galaxy are far from Imperial control. A good definition for what makes a Lone System is that it takes at least ten days to travel to a Lone System.

## Sayshell
First populated in the 11th millennia, Sayshell began as a centre of learning and commerce. It remained so until Star Fleet moved its operations there during Aran War.  Since then, The Star Fleet has protected and looked after Sayshell more so than any other sector. When the war against the Droids looked like all was lost, the Fleet spontaneously retreated to Sayshell and with the aid of Star Sci kept the Droids out. This is the safest Sector in Human Occupied Space.

Sayshell's economy revolves around technology, academia and food production. Although most inventions originate in Sayshell, little is manufactured there. Sayshell is by far the richest and most technological system in the human space, by living there you are assured a job, even if it is in Star Fleet.

## Dorian
The _War of Dorian_ was the closing chapter of The Droid War. Star Fleet had only a skeleton presence, but the people who had repeatedly fought, become overwhelmed and retreated managed to stop the Droids from taking total control. The Imperium soon took the sector back. Dorian grew once more as the production centre of Human Occupied Space once the Droids were expelled. 

Now Dorian produces the most raw materials and technological goods of the three sectors and continues to grow economically. The sector prospers despite poorly funded colonies falling behind in technology. The people of Dorian instinctively make-do-and-mend rather than attempt to continually improve.

## Remmar
Remmar was the last sector to be successfully evacuated before the Droid onslaught, leaving many of the colonies intact. The Droids found empty Orbitals (space stations), left a few Droids as rear guard and moved on. When the Star Fleet eventually pushed the Droids out 2 years ago (92026), they opened up a sector largely untouched by war.

Remmar is a fledgling sector with 1000 year old infrastructure waiting for the humans to return. Huge ghost-town colonies litter planets; enormous Orb and Orbital space stations lie dormant and all of it ready for salvage operations.

The existing Peers aren't interested in Remmar. They see it as a wild, unruly volume of space where their skills aren't required. Star Civ are looking to create new Peers from Remmar itself, a process that's made difficult by the lack of rich industrialists operating there.

# Colonies
A colony is a fixed place where humans live and work. It could be on a planet, in a planet, orbiting around a planet, in an asteroid field, at the edge of a nebula or out in the void between systems. If there are resource or a useful place nearby, humans will live there.

Where close to a planet, systems are chosen where planets have a gravity near to that of Earth and orbit in the Goldilocks zone so that they may be terraformed. Worlds with harsh, toxic climates unsuitable for terrforming have domes built on the surface or huge spheres dug out underneath with an artificial gravity sticking people to the inside of the ball.

Colony industry is usually a mix of mining, manufacturing, agriculture, high tech, leisure and tourism.

> Ecopolitical for estimating gaps in the market/trade opportunities or for understanding the power balance by fusing disparate news sources.

## Council Administration
Colonies are run by a locally elected council of: Chairperson, Treasurer and secretaries important facets of the colony, such as trade, agriculture or mining. Terms are fixed to 4 years and re-election is common. Each councillor commands a budget and retinue of staffers; who investigate, negotiate, troubleshoot and fix. Not always in that order.

Corporations are taxed directly by the Imperium, who grant a budget back to the colony. Only the richest colonies send more than they receive. Larger colonies have Star Enforcers and Star Civilisation officers.

## Crofts
Small villages are built from pill shaped croft buildings, each self-contained in power, living and working space. They range between 15 and 50 metres across and are cheap to build at 10k credits each. Crofts sprout in the centre of lush farmland, at the top of mine complexes and in areas of natural beauty.

As small communities, they are good places to hide if you are welcome. Crime in Crofts tends to be scant or everyone is involved. Anonymity is impossible and the resources are easily tracked.

## Mex Cities
A Mex city is a towering 3D lattice of vertical buildings joined by a maze of walkways. Traffic flies between the buildings, ducking above and below walkways, lifts whoosh up and down the corners of each building impossibly quickly. Each Mex city is built from a prefabricated set of structures, which are then given its own special character buy the colonies that build them.

A Mex building has a square footprint of 100m and typically reaches 4000m into the sky. Levels of the building are clustered by zone, a single building will have homes, commercial and specialised retail outlets. Each level of a Mex building is prefabricated and dropped into place on a building while its still being used, allowing cities to grow vertically with very little disruption.

## Typical Mex City Plan

> Mex 3D plan

### A. Town Centre
Pivotal to the running of the colony, the central clutch of buildings host offices for the council, Star Enforcers, Star Civilisation and toward the top are executive spacecraft gate (see Home Gate below).

The Star Industries on planet (Enforcers and Civilisation) use the town centre for their headquarters but will have smaller offices spread around the city. These offices act as trauma clinics and holding cells.

### B. Home Gate
This is where small atmosphere capable starcraft and Pitlifters dock onto the city. It's cheaper than docking on the town centre gate. Pitlifters are shuttles that carry people and cargo up the gravity well to huge spacecraft in orbit, Orbitals and Orbs.

The home gate Mex buildings are designed for the fast transfer of people and cargo. Spacecraft dock toward the top, cargo is temporarily stored toward the bottom and a swarm of lifts, public transport and cargo Hopper robots caries it all out into the wider city.

Clustered around the home gate is a beautifully groomed commercial district of hotels, tourist retail and services for the arriving traveller.

### C. Freight Gate
Larger spacecraft, such as freighters cling to the outside of the city. Each spacecraft is crewed with tens of people and contains hundreds of thousands of poly-cermaic-alloy cubes called space crates. The crates are moved and managed in a ballet of a thousand flying robots called Hoppers. 

The Freight Gateway has few bars and cheap hotels. Many crews prefer to sleep on the spacecraft but the hotels offer a change of scenery, live music and a range of local entertainment. The vast majority of cargo moves through the freight gate, making it a target for crime.

### D. Hauler Port
At the edge of the city, in the shadow of the freight gate is the Hauler port. Haulers are long arrow like land trains that move cargo around the planet.

Haulers fly on autopilot but have pilots to deal with the rare ocassions where a deal goes wrong. Being in the Nearground (see below), Hauler ports tend to be poorer areas of the city. The lower levels of the Mex buildings host mechanic workshops, low pay bars and hotels, storage areas and little comfort. Although at the edge of the city, the shadows of huge spacecraft docked on makes it difficult to enjoy the view.

## In a Mex City
The picture (on the next page) shows a view looking down the centre of a Mex city. To people who have lived their whole lives in crofts, the Mex City will feel claustrophobic, vertigo inducing, overcrowded and dark. The space between the Mex buildings is packed with traffic (only a small amount shown in the picture for clarity).

### A. Lift
Lifts travel up and down the corners of all buildings. The lifts are extremely fast, specialised flying Grav cars with their own artificial gravity. As they aren't connected to the building, they can pass other lifts.

### B. Walkway 
Structural tubes give the Mex city its lattice strength and allows pedestrians to move between buildings. Walkway density is at its highest toward the bottom and centre of a Mex city. Traffic passes above and below these walkways and they sometimes travel at angles between the buildings. In any case, the gravity inside of the walkway is always perpendicular to its floor.

### C. Traffic
Owning your own personal transport is common and traffic forms ordered streams between the buildings. Flying cars called Grav cars are the most common form of traffic, usually flown on autopilot while the occupants relax. Hauler land trains are common toward the edge, larger utility vehicles (such as the Bull) are found everywhere while Grav bikes zip between them all, seemingly a law unto themselves.

Anyone can fly a Grav on autopilot but doing so is slow. It's legal to fly outside of the traffic streams (Grav Pilot) but doing so quickly and safely is hard. Dangerous driving is reported by other Grav cars immediately and only in the most liberal cities is this ignored.

### D. Free Mass Transportation System (FEMTS)
The Free Mass Transportation System (FEMTS) is found in the vast majority of Human Occupied Space. Thousands of bullet shaped automated FEMTS cars provide clean, reliable and punctual transport. The car is controlled by an artificial intelligence (AI power 2) which senses other traffic in Gaia and then makes decisions on the best route to meet its stops. The FEMTS is widely used by many, as a safe alternative to owning one's own car.

More affluent Cities adorn their FEMTS with bars, relaxation rooms, massage parlours and brothels. Regardless of their internal fittings, the external bullet shape is standard.

### E. The Nearground
The Nearground is the place where those not content with normal society collect.

## The Nearground
The Nearground is the area 'Near to the ground' - the first 50 metres of each Mex building where natural light rarely filters down to. It is where anarchists, socially dispossessed, poor and criminal elements of society live and work. The Imperial society is a liberal one and the Nearground provides a space for the fringes of society to meet, away from those playing by the rules.

The Nearground is where the order of Mex architecture descends into chaos. At ground level, the Mex buildings are difficult to discern, the core layout of the buildings augmented by gantries, walkways and buildings in a high-tech shanty-town, lit by augmented reality holograms where Gaia spills into reality. There is little traffic in the Nearground - only Grav bikes are small and nimble enough to drive quickly through the maze of architectural imagination.

### Typical Nearground Locations
In the Nearground can be found brothels, seedy nightclubs, old-fashioned tea shops, doctors who forget to report things to Star Civilisation, black markets of stolen goods, repair shops that will remove the bullet holes, drug dens, cheap hotels, Grav biker hang outs and burlesque clubs. 

### Star Enforcers and the Nearground
People who live in the Nearground have a talent for passive non-cooperation with the Star Enforcers. Security recordings get corrupted, surveillance equipment is stolen, no-one sees anything or remembers anything. Only when the Star Enfocer tactical units arrive to hunt the really dangerous criminals do the locals start thinking about helping. Justice is still served in the Nearground but the Imperial Nexus is rarely involved.

## The Mesh
Like that of all spacecraft, the superstructure of the Mex buildings contains a maze of air ducts and utility rooms, known as the Mesh. Originally designed for repair crews to work without disturbing the general public, the Mesh has now become home to an outcast part of society, the Meshrunners. The Mesh could be anywhere, so the same rules apply. The General Public are mostly ignorant of Meshrunners, assuming that the thieves and muggers come up from the Nearground in lifts.

### Meshrunners
Meshrunners live in the Mesh, leaving only to steal food and money from the general public. The Mesh is a haven for those on the run from society. Most Meshrunners are children, teenagers and young adults; petty criminals, family outcasts or escapees from the constricts of their upbringing. As Meshrunners grow into adulthood, they usually leave the Mesh for the bright lights and opportunity of the Nearground - or even back into society. Few grow old in the Mesh and even fewer are born there.

Meshrunners form into tight knit gangs, where seniority is defined by time spent in the Mesh. Meshrunner gangs are territorial, spanning many levels and buildings. Friction between gangs is huge; each assuming the other gangs are in league with the Imperium or whoever they ran away from.

### Running the Mesh
Moving through the Mesh is a Skill (Meshrunning) that can only be taught by another Meshrunner. Meshrunners use high tech climbing gear repurposed from common day items that can be hidden under clothing for when they are moving amongst the general public. Running the Mesh is extremely dangerous for the uninitiated as the Mesh is utterly dark and there can be sudden 2km vertical shafts. An experienced Meshrunner will know their Gang's Mesh extremely well and be able to navigate it with only the faintest glow of light.

### Becoming a Meshrunner
Meshrunners are always on the lookout for vulnerable children and teenagers. In most cases, these runaways end up in the Nearground and are unable to fend for themselves. Too young to work and susceptible to exploitation, Meshrunners offer the young outcasts a family life without any of the hassle. Some outcasts hear of the Mesh and go in search of it, which can be dangerous and difficult.

### The Star Enforcers and the Mesh
The Star Enforcers would like the Mesh to be empty save for repair crews. In most cases, the Meshrunners do not draw any attention as their thefts tend to be small and based on subsistence. The Star Enforcers normally leave the Mesh alone as the time and energy spent rounding up Meshrunners is better spent elsewhere. Furthermore, proving a Meshrunner has performed a crime is difficult and the sentences are so short for the petty crimes that they would just return to the Mesh afterwards. Star Civilisation believe that a Meshrunner left uncaught is more likely to return to civilised society than one that is caught and punished.

On rare occassions when Meshrunners disrupt the normal running of a colony, the Star Enforcers deploy bionic Meshrunner officers, who arrest and remove Meshrunners with stunning speed. In the most extreme cases, the Mesh can be sealed, suffocating all those within. This has only happened twice in living memory. 

### Using Meshrunners
Player characters are normally ex-Meshrunners - people who have the skill but do not run the Mesh anymore. Meshrunning Skills replace the standard skills of a person's upbringing (using Gaia, mathematics, science, social understanding) so it is not to be taken lightly. Meshrunners are not included in this book as a character class as they fit into a very specific sort of campaign setting.

Meshrunners make useful contacts, although Meshrunners are wary of anyone outside of the Mesh. Trust must be gained first before a Meshrunner will do any work for a player Character. 

Once trust is gained, a Meshrunner is very useful - able to steal, overhear and rob people before blending back into society. Meshrunners do not use Gaia, so contacting them can be difficult and gaining one as a valuable contact is likely to be a haphazard affair involved in a chance encounter.

## Privacy in a Surveillance Future
Modern artificial intelligence feeds on data. From building amospheric control to a Grav car's autopilot, collecting of data is everywhere. The Imperium tightly guards the privacy of its citizens with harsh penalties of anyone who collects data without consent.

Anywhere that the general public can be reasonably expected to go cannot be recorded without the express permission of the Imperium. Within private spaces, then it's only legal to capture sensor information if it going to be immediately processed by an AI and then forgotten. This is enough to give a level of security but not so much to invade someone's privacy.

## Colony Travel
A colony spreads across the planet's surface. There are common elements on every colony.  

- A. Large spacecraft that cannot enter the atmosphere either dock to an Orb (or Orbital) from where they can undock and light jump to other systems. 
- B. Cargo is transported from orbit using Pitlifters, which are specifically designed to make the journey between orbit and planet surface. 
- C and E. For spacecraft that can enter atmosphere, they dock either straight onto the Mex city (C) or the croft (E).  The croft would have to have a very large output to warrant a freighter going straight there. Some crofts have their own Pitlifters.
- D. Cargo and people are transported between surface dwellings by high speed Haulers and sub orbital flyers. 

> SUB ORBITAL SHARD FLYERS

# Time
When the first spacefarers left Earth, they abandoned the 24 hour clock in favour of a 40 hour day, running two shifts of 20 hours. The day is split into four 10 hour cycles. Each cycle serves a different purpose. Between each cycle is a meal.

As everyone is living in a synchronised 40 hour lifestyle, businesses stay open for all 40 hours. People tend to share jobs, one job between two. The passing of day and night has no effect on the cycles of a person, phrases such as 'morning' and 'afternoon' are normally used to express the position of the sun in the sky. 

### Sleep Cycle
During the cycle, a person get their rest. A human of 92030 only requires 9 hours sleep in 40 to function properly. The other hour is spent waking up and having the first meal called breakfast.

### Work Cycle One
This is the first ten hours of work. Some take two jobs, each with a 10 hour duration. After this cycle is a meal called lunch.

### Work Cycle Two
The second work cycle is normally a more relaxed affair as motivation begins to wane. After this cycle is the meal called dinner.

### Recreation Cycle
The recreation cycle is when a person can pursue hobbies and personal goals. Before sleeping once more, a person normally partakes in a nutrient drink called a _cap_.

### Organisation of Years and Dates
Following the standardisation of time, dates and years followed suit. The organisation is as follows:

- Minute: 60 seconds.
- Hour: 60 minutes.
- Cycle: 10 hours.
- Day: 4 cycles (40 hours).
- Week: 10 days.
- Month: 4 weeks (40 days).
- Year: 10 months (400 days).

The month names are the same as the Gregorian calendar, except November and December are omitted. Days are named as Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Moriusday (after the previous Emperor), Solday (named after the system that bore the human race) and Thousanday (after the space station that became the cradle of human civilisation). Naming of the days has become unimportant as there is no weekend as such - people spend 10 hours of recreation every day. People simply refer to the date.

### Public Holidays
Although business runs 40x40, regardless of day and night, there are still public holidays. Days during the week are not taken off and there is no 'weekend'. The public holidays tend to mark events throughout Human Occupied Space (Empress' birthday) or locally (cluster or system founding day). Those systems without much local history tend to have fewer public holidays, as do heavily industrialised systems. Artistic colonies and those systems with a long history tend to have more.

The Star Chambers do not partake in public holidays, except in an official capacity.  The only exception to this rule is the Empress' birthday when most Star Chambers throw a party.

### Day and Night
The connection with time and night and day is no longer important. Very few planets have 40 hour day and the human race has got used to sleeping at the end of the 30 hours, rather than when it gets dark. This is especially important on planets where there isn't much night due to the light from large moons or on Orbitals, where day and night are simulated by glowing lights.

# Money
The Imperium has one single currency, the Imperial credit (or just credit). Money value and flow is controlled by the Imperial Resource Chamber. There are no banks, you cannot get a loan and money is stored on small plastic cards, on a Gaiacard or in a person's personal Gaia space (see section on Gaia).

No frills living in Icar is cheap. A comfortable apartment can be rented for 100 credits a month and healthy meals cost as little 3 credits. A general price list is included in the Appendix (see the General Items Price List on page XXXXX). Weapons, ammunition and armour are all relatively expensive as the Imperium believes that people should not need to buy them.

The Imperium raises taxes only through businesses. Corporations hand the Imperium a percentage of their revenue (not profit) automatically when doing business. It is possible for a Corporation to avoid paying tax but it is not advised as the Imperium will seize all assets immediately upon discovery, anyone found running a business will undoubtedly end up in a penal colony. Small time operations are ignored, fostering the spirit of entrepreneurship.

All private banking (loans, interest on savings etc) is strictly forbidden and there is no stock market. Loan sharks do exist but are not used by the general populace. Interest rates from Loan sharks are extremely high and failure to pay can be deadly. Some colonies use their own currency but it is often for very ceremonial or tourist industries.

# Space Stations
Space stations are huge cities that either orbit a planet, nestle within asteroid belts, skim the edge of nebulae or lay deep in space. They serve as trade outposts for freighters too large to climb back up the gravity well, homes for millions of souls and microgravity manufacturing centres and space docks.

For many, a space station is the gateway to the rest of Human Occupied Space, having left the surface colony on a Pitlifter to seek out wealth and a life elsewhere.

## Space Station Types
Space stations are grouped into orbs and orbitals. Orbs are huge sphere where the population live on the inside, their world curving upwards and overhead rather than down. Orbitals is a catch-all term for all other space stations and covers a bewildering variety of shapes and sizes. 

## Orbitals
Common across the galaxy, the shape and size of an orbital can tell you a lot about the history and status of the colony. Some are a chaos of jutting angles, formed by merging thousands of salvaged broken down space craft; others are neat, functional geometric shapes to fill a specific purpose and then there are the artfully sculpted ballet of organic cuves and art deco geometry.

The largest orbitals house around 2 billion people and rival orbs in size, measuring 1000km at their widest. The smallest are 5 people on a freighter that entered orbit and couldn't leave. Most orbitals have a few million inhabitants and can serve thousands of spacecraft each day.

Gravity in all space stations is artificial however the more ragged the design of the space station, the more often and jarring the gravity changes its frame of reference, which can be upsetting for newcomers.

### Community and Transport
Orbitals tend to cluster people together into 3D villages, where people live, work, shop and play within the same cubic kilometre. Every orbital works hard to maintain a sense of identity for each village because if a person feels like they belong in a place then they are more likely to look after it. It's well known that orbital dwellers are more friendly than those living on surface or orb and they take that sense of friendly community with them.

Tubes connect the villages, down which traffic like any other colony travels. The better designed a space station is, the smoother it is to drive down the tunnels.

### Psychological effects of living in an Orbital
People who live in Orbitals prefer enclosed spaces and can be agoraphobic (afraid of open spaces). They become accustomed to sharpley changing gravity and people walking on the walls. Vertigo is rare.

### The Orbital Explained
This image shows a simple cross-section of a common orbital with the main sections marked out. The top of the orbital is the part furthest from the planet surface.

- A. The largest spacecraft dock onto 'foils' furthest from the centre. The most expensive external docking sections are at the top of the orbital.
- B. Freighters can also dock on the upper reaches of an orbital but this is normally only for short stays and rapid unloads. Normally executive and courier spacecraft dock on the upper reaches.
- C. Every orbital has at least one artificial biosphere where plants, trees, grass and wild animals live in a carefully balanced ecosystem. Expensive restaurants and apartments look out over the biosphere and most have public paths.
- D. The ubiquitous Free Mass Transportation System (FEMTS) and private cars travel up and down inside the docking foils, transporting people back and forth to freighters. Automaton Hoppers are used for moving space crates.
- E. The main living space is crisscrossed with tubes that carry traffic. Smaller tubes (not shown) stretch out from the main tubes like veins, reaching throughout the superstructure.
- F. Pitlifter shuttles travel back and forth between planet surface and the orbital. The Pitlifter usually docks internally and near the living space.
- G. Internal space crate storage is expensive and normally only used by families, small businesses and spacecraft repair companies.
- H. Spacecraft less than 2km in length can be accommodated in internal docking bays for repair.
- I. Most space crates carrying large quantities of raw materials (which are cubes 10m to a side) are stored external on a docking foil. If tens of thousands of space crates are to be loaded or unloaded, then spacecraft are often docked onto this foil and are serviced by a huge swarm of Automaton Hoppers.
- J. Engineering is where the generators and Grav engine are located. It is the hub of repair and refurbishment, populated by enthusiasts under the pay of the orbital. Engineering is off limits to the general public.

## Orbs
An orb is an inside-out planet, a huge hollow sphere where the people live on the inside. The inside surface of the orb is often as large as a large moon and contains continents, mountains and oceans; which supports a huge, artificial ecosystem. Gravity is produced by localised Grav field generators, making sure the inhabitants have a constant gravity downwards, keeping them on the inside of the sphere. The atmosphere is created and maintained by a series of atmosphere processing plants that exhaust through the oceans. 

To give the inside a feeling of a planet, a huge light source (which is given a different name on each orb, commonly known as The Solar) with a hood rotates in two axis in the middle of the orb. This gives the appearance of light and dark. When looking 'up' on the orb, you see the ground on the other side. During the day, the sun obscures the dark side of the world and the atmosphere gives a pleasant blue haze. Looking 'up' at night time, you will see a blue blur, without stars as if a moon was lighting high cloud.

The Orb is so large that the curvature of the surface is barely recognisable unless it is a clear day. Most people's day to day lives can be lead without ever realising they were not on a planet. Under the crust of the inner surface is a huge number of manufacturing bays and zero-g workshops.

### Orb Segments
An orb is made up of tens of thousands of triangular segments, each generating its own power and gravity. Transit tubes are used for moving around, although communities are created much like normal cities, towns and villages on any other planet. They are huge tube highways that curve throughout the structure below the ground level of the orb. Most people live in cities, towns and villages on the inside work below ground level. 

### Social Considerations
Due to an orb's size, there is more than enough room for everyone to live on the surface, regardless where they actually work. On a few desirably located orbs, space can be at a premium and one can own a share of the surface. This makes the orb much like any other planet, with large Mex cities for convenience and then out-of-the-way places of beauty for the rich.

### Psychological effects of living in an Orb
Unlike on an orbital, the inhabitants of an Orb are unlikely to become agoraphobic (fear of open spaces) as the surface provides a wide-open space, akin to a planet. Claustrophobia (fear of closed in spaces) is also unlikely as the human subconscious knows that it is on the inside of a giant marble. 

Where orb dwellers have problems is with Convexophobia, which is the fear of slipping off a planet's surface. In an orb, the ground curves up at the horizon (concave), giving it a bowl shape. On a planet surface, the ground curves down at the horizon (convex), giving the appearance that things can slide off the side of the sphere.

### Orb Administration
Due to its size and general resemblance of a planet, an orb always has its own administration and will have a councillor on the seat of the controlling planet of the system. In systems where an orb has a larger population than the planet colony it orbits, the orb will have a council.

Docking charges for orbs tend to be insignificant or non-existant as there is so much space to dock. This can lead to spacecraft being abandoned on an orb.

### Jungle Orbs
When The Droid War started, many people fled orbs in search of a safer planet surface; the rational fear being that orbs were easier to destroy than an entire planet. As such Droids often left orbs alone - their ecosystems intact. Left unchecked the wildlife of the inside of the orb spread throughout the superstructure. These jungle orbs often do have people living on them but life can be difficult there as the flora and fauna constantly encroaches on crops and infrastructure.

Jungle orbs are rare in Sayshell and most common in Remmar and the edges of Dorian. As jungle orbs are often the product of a rapid mass evacuation, they often contain treasures abandoned by those too preoccupied with Armageddon to think about what is being left behind.

### Orbai
The Orbai (pronounced Orb - eye) is the name given to the artificially intelligent brain that controls the general running of the orb, like that of a spacecraft. The Orbai can be used as an information source for the inhabitants and normally has an automaton avatar that represents it. 

The Orbai is very careful not to intrude into people's lives and only has sensors where it requires them for controlling the orb. The orbai is not allowed to go through ascension and is capped at artificial intelligence Power 4 (see Artificial Intelligence Power on XXXXXX).

### The Orb Explained
- A. Spacecraft less than 2km long can use the radial tunnels to enter the atmospheric area of the orb. It is expensive to do so and not encouraged.
- B. The Solar gives the orb a day and night cycle. Normally it's set to 12-14 hours. For clarity, the diagram shows daytime across the Orb but in reality, the right hand half of the orb would be shrouded in darkness half the time. The sun is powered centrally and hangs on Grav, unsupported by wires. It lets out a Sun-like UV balanced light. Orb dwellers often proudly declare that twilight and dawn on an orb is more beautiful than any in nature.
- C. As the orb is a fully functioning ecosystem, it also has clouds like any normal world. The atmosphere is regulated by carefully control plants and algae located in the seas. Orbs can be set up to be temperate, arid, cool or any combination of conditions.
- D. A Mex city. People live in orbs much like any other colony. Very few people live anywhere other than the surface.
- E. Storage and heavy industry is found under the land mass, huge caverns that stretch for miles are organised entirely by an army of automatons.
- F. Crofts. An orb has the advantage of being self-supporting by growing its own food. Croft output tends to be very high as the environment can be controlled with great ease compared to a planet's surface.
- G. Radial tunnels measure more than 5km in diameter and connect the outer skin to the inner atmosphere. They are used for spacecraft docking inside, service craft and pleasure trips.
- H. Every orb uses seas to help regulate the environment and provide a source of sustainable food in the form of plants and fish. Early on in an orb's life, it is the seas that provide while the land gains it nutrients.
- I. The area under the surface of the landmass is called the hull. The hull is used for industry such as factories and raw material processing. Few people live in this area.
- J. The outer hull is where the Orb generates its power, contains its generators and Grav systems to maintain orbit. Unlike Orbitals, Orbs have millions of smaller generators and always produces a great deal more power than it needs. It also provides a place for most spacecraft to dock.
- K. The outer skin is a 20km thick armoured metal skin, pock marked from years of meteorite impacts but tough enough to withstand collision with just about anything. Thousands of huge iris airlocks allow spacecraft through. Orbs are too large to have shields, so this thick skin is the only protection with space.

# Space Travel
Since mankind strode upright and gazed up at the night sky it has wondered what it would be like to visit the tiny points of light that hung overhead. Space travel is commonly available though only 30% regularly travel. Space travel can be a requirement of work, a lifestyle choice or used for entertainment purposes. Spacecraft do not require fuel, have an artificial gravity and there are no ill effects to light jumping. Travel is cheap, most can afford a comfortable bunk, albeit on an indirect route with a few changes (price list in appendix).

The space-time continuum is littered with dangerous faults, most of which are charted and avoided. Some come and go at such speed, that the craft can be enveloped by them before they can be avoided. Even after 90,000 years of space travel, this danger gives space travel a sense of danger.

## How to read Sector maps
The Sector maps from Human Occupied Space can be found in the Appendix. The map below shows a portion of Remmar. Space is curved and not two dimensional so the maps are an approximation to reality.

> Remmar Sector part map

- A. Cluster. The coloured blobs are clusters and the white between them are notional edges of those clusters. The nearer to red (or darker the grey) the Cluster is, the more colonies it has. A colony can number only 100 people, but it still counds.
- B. Named Cluster. Only Anadar has a full description as it is the Cluster used in the included Scavenger Setting. A brief description can be found on each; more information on the Icar website.
- C. The Zero Line. The Zero Line is a grey line that runs down the centre of the galactic arm. It represents 0 in the grid. 
- D. Rim 1. As an example, the horizontal line underneath 'D' is the first line towards the Rim.
- E. Spin line. The vertical lines are spin lines, and number 'up' from right to left. The spin lines are labelled along the bottom of the graph and are not shown here for simplicity.

## Using the Grid
The grid is used for finding clusters. The horizontal lines are called either hub or rim lines. The lines above the white zero line are hub lines. This is because if you carried on in that direction, you would head toward the centre of the galaxy. Horizontal lines below the zero line are rim lines. This is because if you headed in that direction (down the page), you would be heading out of the galaxy. The vertical lines are spin lines and they number right to left.

To locate a Cluster, first find the nearest horizontal hub or rim line. If it sits between two lines, choose the line nearest the zero and call it 'middle'. Next, you find the nearest vertical spin line and if it sits between two, choose the lowest value and call it 'middle'.

> For example, the cluster labelled by 'A' sits between rim lines 2 and 3. As the vertical spin lines are not numbered on this example, assume its spin line is 23. Therefore, the cluster location would be: Rim 2 Middle, Spin 23.

If the cluster sits on the zero Line, it's called 'Zero'. If it sits between the zero line and either hub 1 or rim 1, it is called 'Hub 0 Middle' or 'Rim 0 Middle'.

## Examples of Named Clusters
For more examples, here are the grid locations for all of the named clusters. You can find the sector Maps in the appendix. The sectors are included for ease but they are not required as the spin lines will give you the Sector you are in.

### Remmar Sector
- Juno Cluster: Hub 1 Middle, Spin 22
- Tef Cluster: Rim 5 Middle, Spin 23
- Anadar: Hub 0 Middle, Spin 28
- Corisk: Zero, Spin 28
- Imperial Crescent: Hub 2, Spin 37

### Sayshell Sector
- Vitero: Rim 4, Spin 47
- Turus: Hub 1, Spin 41
- Romar: Hub 6, Spin 54
- Niopak: Hub 3, Spin 54 Middle
- Naggachef: Rim 2, Spin 56 Middle

### Dorian Sector
- Akar: Hub 4 Middle, Spin 69 Middle
- Baeleris: Rim 2, Spin 74

## Reading Cluster Maps
A cluster map shows the locations of systems and other features within a cluster. Cluster maps are based on a 20 sided grid. Each box on the cluster map represents one light lump unit. In one hour, you can move up to as many squares on this map as you have light jump on your spacecraft. All jumps take at least one hour.

## Classifying Space
Before you can explore it, you need to know what you are dealing with. Space is classified depending on what is round it:

- *Atmosphere*. Not strictly space as such but the first step one must make before getting there. Atmosphere is classed as the first 20km between the lowest point on the surface (sea level) and space.
- *Low Orbit*. Between 20km and 500km is low orbit. If a craft is not atmosphere capable, then this is the nearest to the surface it can get. Most large vessels use this altitude for the loading and unloading of cargo. There's usually a fee for parking in low orbit.
- *High Orbit*. From 500km to 1000km is known as high orbit. This is where the Orbitals exist and where Point To Point light jumps can be performed from. There's no charge for staying in high orbit.
- *System Space*. Within the outermost planet's orbit around a star is system space. In a place with few planets, the edge of system space depends on the gravitational pull of the star.
- *Dead Space*. Dead space is the area that is not governed gravitationally by a star or its planets; the force provided by them is too weak to be useful to a non-light jump Grav engine. Most of the universe is dead space but you have to go a long way from a star to be in it.

## Jobs in space
Aside from Star Enforcer police in Human Occupied Space and the Star Fleet outside of it, there are lots of ways to earn a living in space.

_Traders_ move goods between systems; where possible for profit and also because a colony council pays them to do so. Half of trader Captains own their own craft; the other half belong to a co-operative trade corporation. Traders also carry passengers for a modest fee.

_Couriers_ move high value items for their wealthy clientele. Most couriers book travel on other spacecraft; the more successful own their own, highly specialised craft.

_Void Rescue_ is a spacecraft breakdown service but the name is used for all rescue services. More on Void Rescue below. XXXXXXXX

_Deep Space Scavengers_ are explorers who find, repair and return (or sell) valuable items from the millions of abandoned systems, spacecraft, orbitals and orbs. Scavengers are the topic of the included setting, see XXXXXXXX.

_Expeditionaries_ venture beyond the light jump net into the Fringe and Droid space. Bounty hunters, artefact investigators, criminal capture and rescue teams. They are a quasi-military force operating outside the laws of humanity.

## Buying your own Spacecraft
Brand new spacecraft are very expensive and the Imperium has outlawed interest loans. The most popular ways of getting hold of a spacecraft are (most expensive first):

- *Buy new from the manufacturer*. Spacecraft can cost millions. A wealthy benefactor may gift you the spacecraft.
- *Buying second hand from a corporation*. Spacecraft are still expensive at 30% of the brand new price but for small corporations, this is often the best way.
- *Operate a Spacecraft for a Trade Company*. Trade Companies loan spacecraft to crews and require a minimum amount of return each month. The better the craft on loan, the more return required.
- *Buy a junker*. The best entry level spacecraft is an old refurbished  junker. These spacecraft come with only the basics but can be bought for as little as 25 000. Of course, you might spend a lot of time repairing the junker and it will not be as fast as a new craft but it will get you about.
- *Find your own salvage*. There are always spacecraft that were abandoned as the Droids spread across Human Occupied Space. Salvaged craft are free will need the most technical skill to get them running.

## The Starbus
The Starbus is a public transport network that connects major systems and clusters together. It is slow, reliable and cheap transportation through the void. The Starbuses are huge spacecraft and like orbitals they self-organised into village zones such that the rich separate themselves from the poor. The Starbus is so large that they never go down to the surface of the planet but instead are served by Pitlifter shuttle craft (many have their own). 

Every Starbus has a number of berths that are set aside for free travel. The births are communal and comparatively cramped but the atmosphere is fun and free. Most Starbuses have a notion that the maximum time you can spend in a communal bunk is 1 month, but this is rarely enforced and it is common for some people to live for most of their lives this way.

### Starbus Naturals
Starbus Naturals is the name given to people who permanently stay on a Starbus, using it as a means to see the Galaxy. A Starbus's route often rarely circles back on the same system, it is a good way to see lots of different places. Naturals are considered part of the crew and family, although they serve no function but to pay their way.

## Void Rescue
Void Rescue is the space rescue service. If your spacecraft has broken down, you can call Void Rescue to come and help. With over 1 million spacecraft across all Human Occupied Space, their yellow and black stripes are instantly recognisable and affectionately known as Bees. The crews are highly trained engineers, who can help find problems with your spacecraft. Most trade spacecraft have Void Rescue insurance cover and some colonies require it before awarding a trade contract.

## Spaceflight Types
Faster than light travel has been a goal of the human race since the laws of physics made the speed of light a boundary. In normal space, it is a boundary but there is more to the space-time continuum than just normal space. Every trans-light vehicle is given a light jump speed. This speed is the number of boxes on a cluster map the craft can go in 1 hour. A cluster is approximately 20 squares in diameter. Use this a rule of thumb for unknown clusters.

### Grav
When travelling between ground, space and between planets in a system, Grav is used. Grav works by surfing down the gravitational waves created by celestial objects (stars, planets and moons).

The speed of every spacecraft is measured as the time in minutes it takes to do each transition: surface to orbit, between planets and then for each square on a cluster map. As a rule of thumb, most craft take 60 minutes (1 hour) to go between planets, climb an energy well or get clear enough from a system to perform a light jump. 

Grav suffers from zero gravity deficiency. This means that if the Grav engine is in a place where the gravities of objects around it cancel out. This dead zone is rare and is unlikely to last for very long but will cause the Grav ship to be stranded.

### Light Jump
Light jumping is the most comment method of travelling in space. The process begins with the spacecraft Captain choosing a desintation, the spacecraft intelligence then plots the safest route given the starchart and sensor data. The light jump engine then forms a bubble around the spacecraft, which detatches the ship from Einsteinian physics, which allows the Grav engine to push the spacecraft beyond the speed of light. The bubble has a limited lifespan and when it collapses, the spacecraft comes to a halt. The light jump engine must then recharged before the next bubble can be formed. Most modern spacecraft can recharge the engine in a matter of minutes.

Bigger spacecraft need much more energy to form a light jump bubble, which do not last as long and take longer to recharge. Standard light jump engines must be away from large gravitational forces to form the bubble, which usually means on the edge of a system.

Light jumps are susceptible to space-time faults. The bubble is likely to immediately collapse when encountering one - requiring the vessel to make another jump. It is uncommon that any damage will be done to the light jump engine unless it is old or already damaged.

#### Point to Point light jump
Point to Point (PTP) light jump engines use the same science as a standard light jump but use more powerful light jump engines and more accurate Grav engines for very precise jumps. They are more complex, expensive and have a size limit. It has two main benefits:

1. PTP can begin a light jump from high orbit, clear of any orbitals.
2. PTP can end a jump in high orbit, although it's illegal to do so in Human Occupied Space as the risk of collision is high.

### Curve Surf Engine
Rumoured to be the invention of rogue Star Sci scientists for a practical joke, the curve surf engine has unofficially been used by the Star Fleet for a thousand years. Like Grav, it surfs down the gravity supplied by celestial objects but unlike light jumps, it does not pre-calculate the journey beforehand. This is usually quicker but is more unpredictable as it relies space-time eddies and the skill of a pilot. The power required by the curve surf engine allows the jump bubble to form in high orbits like PTP.

Unlike other light jumps, curve surfing requires a pilot for some parts of the journey as navigating a fast route without bursting the jump bubble is as much an art as a science.

> New example of piloting CS

Curve surf is expensive. Each engine must be crafted to fit the precise specifications of the spacecraft and the amount of energy required means that a lot of the internal space is taken up by power generation. Few craft are produced with a curve surf engine although it is possible to find an engineer (Street Deal, Target Number 18) to build a custom one. The cost of such an engine and upgrade will be approximately the cost of the space craft when it was new.

## Dangers in Space
Space is a dangerous place. It's no wonder that most of the human population prefer to stay put. Most of the problems that occur in space are more of an irritation (costly to those who use space for business) than a risk to life. It is, however, unpredictable. This section deals with some of the problems that can occur, they are either space-time faults or not.

### Quantum Singularities
A quantum singularity is the scientific name given to things that are inexplicable, unpredictable and really quite dangerous. They can arise without warning, be difficult to sense and can have a number of effects on a star craft:

- *Drop out of light jump.* Can be caused by the singularity draining power from the generators momentarily or similar energy 'blip'.
- *Incorrect Sensor Readings.* Either echoes from times past or reversed sensor information is another often occurrence with singularities. The sensor information of a planet may momentarily pop up in the path of ship (causing a drop out of light jump).
- *Weirdness.* Alterations in gravity on ship, atmosphere conditions or the biological state of the crew are all part of deep space weirdness.
- *Total Energy Shut Down.* Perhaps the worst-case scenario, this would involve the main generators shutting down completely. Restarting generators can often take days.

### Worm Holes
These are tunnels that connect different places in the space-time continuum for a limited time. Some recurr, but those are not dangerous: they are listed amongst the star charts as avoids. If a light jump takes a craft through a worm-hole then the position of the craft in space and time is unpredictable. There is a 50/50 chance that the light jump bubble will collapse before entering the worm-hole, in this case the spacecraft will be left on the event horizon.

Worm holes are not to be entered, they are extremely dangerous and a craft must be specially designed to cope with the huge pressures and energy flux within the tunnel.

### Energy Ripples
When a celestial event occurs (such as a star exploding - a super nova) then a huge sphere of ripples spreads out, leaving very little where the star once was. When this occurs, huge ripples of energy are left travelling, getting weaker as they spread. However, there are areas where they may gain energy and when this occurs they can become dangerous once more.

The least a ripple will do is drop a craft out of light jump. With more powerful ripples, the ship may be push off course and damaged as well. The worst an energy ripple can do is to carry the ship through the light jump net into the lone systems and cripple it. 

### Asteroid Fields
When celestial objects explode, they leave debris. Unless there is some sort of a gravitational field to do this, they will remain in rings and spheres. In most areas of space, these are charted, but they can move and the detonation of stars can cause their satellites to become asteroid fields.

The worst a field can do is drop the craft out of light jump. If the field is large enough to do damage to the vessel, then it will be detected early on.

### Super-Dense Nebulae
A nebula is a huge cloud of gas. Most nebulae are harmless, the major bodies within it mapped out such that travellers may not have a collision. Dense nebulae are more dangerous as they hold stars being born. The energy involved in such a process can cause energy ripples (see above).

### Technical Fault
This can occur of very old vessels. Most vehicles have an AI which can scan for problems within the ship. However, the difficulty is not always detecting the problem, but solving it.

Total energy loss is the worse case scenario. If the generators shut down then there is no power to go anywhere and help must be summoned. 

### Gravity Nulls
A Gravity null is a point in space where the gravity pull of surrounding stars cancel out. This is a problem for Grav engines and light jump engines because they all require a Gravity source to push or pull against.

If you find yourself in a gravity null, you could be stuck there for minutes, hours, days or years.  Gravity nulls can be both predictable (listed in Star charts and avoided) and unpredictable. They can pulse on and off and some are even used by pirates, who lie in wait for a spacecraft to come to a halt.

### Pirates
Uncommon in Dorian, common in Remmar and impossibly unlikely in Sayshell, pirates are those people with armed craft that attack other craft. Depending on their motives and the Captain, the pirates may just take the cargo or murder the crew as well. 

Pirates choose targets that look soft. They are well organised and educated, researching their targets and finding fences for the cargo before attacking. It is often thought that Pirates are amongst the best-trained ship crews.
