# Introduction
Icar is a space opera science fiction, set 90,000 years into the future. A benevolent, autocratic Imperium protects the human race from a rarely-seen race of killer robots called the Droids. With the Droid advance halted, human occupied space is a trove of opportunity for the Characters to explore. There are no intelligent alien species, travel between the stars is commonplace, friendly robots called Automatons live as slaves and family members, corporations are duplicitous villains, and a quasi-reality internet called Gaia is both the backbone of civilisation and the playground of hackers.

In a single session, players will be exploring long deserted colonies and abandoned spacecraft, starting bar fights, hacking corporate secrets, escaping colonies invaded by Droids and zipping between the stars. As the characters grow they can choose bionics or powered armour, wield more powerful weapons and own their own spacecraft.

The mechanics of Icar are intended to be cinematic, based on using ten-sided dice (D10), common sense should reign over rulings, choose speed over accuracy and if a player comes up with an idea that improves fun at the table, go with it.

This book contains a description of the core mechanics, a section describing the broader galaxy according to Icar, an example campaign setting called Scavengers, Equipment and Technology, Gamesmaster section, and a series of resources, such as Character sheets and quick reference. 

# Character Creation
Characters are imaginary people that players use to interact with the game world. A character is a playing piece that grows and changes with experience. Creating a character is a matter of following the steps detailed below.

The main properties of an Icar Character are:

- Concept and class.
- Attributes
- Deviant
- Skills
- Body
- Close combat combos
- Psychotheatrics

The concept is a description of what the character is about. Are they a pacifist spacecraft Captain or technology obsessed engineer? A class is a character's job, which provides the skills and equipment the character starts with. Attributes are the natural characteristics of the character, such as how strong they are. 

The deviant represents the personality of the character, whether they are flamboyant or withdrawn, patient or restless and so on. The skills are a list of things that the character can do. They include driving, fixing technology or bartering. Hit points denote how much damage you can take before death and stun is the ability to stay conscious. Psychotheatrics are randomly rolled advantages and disadvantages and are optional.

A character is written down on two character sheets. The first contains deviant, attributes, hit points, stun, close combat combos and general character information, such as their name. The second contains equipment, skills and psychotheatrics.

## Step 1: Concept
The concept is a couple of sentences that describes who the character is. The concept should give a person a good understanding of the character's personality, passions and quirks. It helps the character's player keep a sense of consistency and know how the character might react in various situations. It also helps other players and gamesmaster understand your character too. There is no formal space on the character to write your concept, so please use the back side, margins or notebook.

A concept should make sense in the setting you are going to be playing. Each setting provides some examples of concepts to use as inspiration. Some concepts are more appropriate for a setting, just ask your gamesmaster. For example, an anarchistic character does not fit well in a military setting where rules are there to keep you alive.

A good way to quickly make a concept is to take two characters from film or TV and join them together to make something more interesting. The result will normally need a little adjustment to fit into the Icar universe.

> Example: Take Johnny Mnemonic and Neil from The Young Ones. A ruthless corporate man, who eats purely organic food and has a deep love for furry animals and flowers.

If you are still stuck on a character concept and you are being hurried to decide, then choose a clichÃ©! Perhaps a rogue smuggler (Han Solo from Star Wars) or retired cop (Deckard from Bladerunner). New players should avoid playing characters that are quiet, withdrawn or anti-social. It is much easier to play Icar if you character is keen on friendship with the other characters and wants to speak!

Do not worry if your concept is not perfect, as the character experiences different things its deviant, skills and motivations will change. If you do not start with the character you would like, you can always grow it in a new direction.

Our example character, John Smith, will use one of the given concepts in the Scavenger Setting (see XXXXXXXXXXXXX). Below is the example character concept.

### Class
A class is a package of starting skills, equipment and background that needs to be chosen alongside the concept. It's best to think of a concept first and then choose a class but experienced players might prefer selecting both at the same time. 

Classes can be found in the setting your gamesmaster is going to run, there are no generic Icar classes as Icar. If no class exists for your character concept, then use ones from the setting as a guide and suggest your own to the gamesmaster.

## Step 2: Deviant
The deviant is the personality of the character and suggests what the character might do in any situation. The deviant of the character is recorded in the deviant wheel. The wheel is made from a number of personality traits. Opposite traits are on opposite sides of the wheel. For example, on one side is selfish, on the other is generous. You'll find the deviant wheel on the front Character sheet.

To fill in the deviant wheel, go around to each of the traits and colour in up to 5 of the boxes. Both sides of the wheel must add up to 5. If you have 5 in fiery, then you have 0 in Calm. Below shows an example deviant wheel. Only one trait is filled in. In general, pleasant Character traits (generous, honest, forgiving) are on the right hand side of the wheel, and unpleasant traits (selfish, vengeful, dishonest) are on the left.

> Tip: Pick two or three traits you know you would like to play, colour them in up to four and colour in their opposites at one. For all the others, either colour them in as 3 and 2 or leave them blank and fill them in as you play the character.

Let's take a look at the deviant wheel for our example character, John Smith. It's filled in for a generally nice person who is a bit naive and is easily excitable.

XXX PICTURE - John Smith Deviant Wheel

Don't worry if you don't get it correct to begin with as deviant wheel can be changed using roleplaying points.

Do not be bound by the deviant wheel, it is there as a guide to help you keep the character's decisions consistent. There might be times when the event is so life changing that the character reacts far outside of their normal personality. In those cases, you might consider using that event as a reason to change he character's personality.

## Step 3: Attributes
Attributes are the physical and mental properties of the character. There are five attributes in Icar: Battle, Shift, Meat, Soul and Wit. 

Each attribute is on a scale of 1 to 5. A value of 1 is human lowest and 5 is the human maximum. The human average is 2. If the character becomes augmented with bionics, then attributes can go beyond 5.
All attributes begin at 1 and then you spend points to increase them in the same way that you do for roleplaying points. 

All attributes start at one and then you spend 20 roleplaying points to increase them. Raising to 2 costs 2 roleplaying points, raising to 3 costs 5 because you must raise to 2 and then raise to 3. The cost is 2 for the first raise and 3 for the second, this adds up to 5.

### Quick Attribute Assignment
Rather than working out each of the levels and spending up your points, you could assign one of the following groups of values to your attributes. They add up to 20 Roleplaying points: 4,3,2,2,2 or 3,3,3,1 or 5,2,2,1.

### Battle
Battle is the ability of the character to fight. This includes physical ability as well as natural prowess in combat. It is used for combat actions, deciding initiative and building close combat fighting. Battle does not cover how hard you hit something, just how well you do it. 

Having a Battle of 1 means you fight like a flailing child. A Battle of 5 means you are more lethal than a bionic Bruce Lee.

### Meat
Meat is character's toughness. It controls how much they can carry (see Encumbrance), how hard they can hit something, how many hits they can take before passing out (see Stun), how resistant they are to poisons (such as alcohol) and how physically large they are. 

Having a Meat of 1 means you are an scrawny weakling; 5 a muscle bound body-builder.

### Shift
Shift controls the quickness of the character. This includes how far the character can move, how dexterous they are and the likelihood of having the upper hand in a fight. 

Multiply your Shift by 8 to find the furthest you can move in a turn in metres. This should be only an indicator as combat is more fluid than taking measurements will allow.

### Soul
Soul is a measure of the character's humanity, life-force and mental strength. A low Soul is easily frightened and has trouble dealing with gory or bloody scenes. A high Soul recognises their fear but is not driven by it.

Failing a Soul check can lead the character into a blind panic. Passing a Soul check can mean the Character does not blurt out the location of the money stash. A panicking character isn't able to perform any useful action and you should roleplay a panic stricken character to freeze, run amok or act irresponsibly.

>Tip: If you want to play a bionic character then it pays to have a high Soul to start with as you trade in your humanity for technology; you spend your Soul.

### Wit
Wit is the measure of intelligence and the ability to spot things. A high Wit is likely to notice details and will have more divine inspiration (hints from the gamesmaster). 

A low Wit is unlikely to notice even the most obvious indications and will have difficulty reasoning logically. This can be useful to you because you can use a low Wit to justify actions that are fun but not necessarily a good idea!

### Classes and Attributes
Some classes included in the setting have recommended attribute values. These suggest that for a given class, the Wit should be over 4 or Meat over 5. These are only recommendations to help the character be useful to the team.

A combat monster concept with a Security class XXXXX and a low Battle attribute might be useless in a fight. If intentional, the could be fun but frustrating if not!

## Step 4: Skills
Where attributes make up the natural physical description of the character, the skills represent the learnt abilities. A character is likely to learn a great many skills and grow their role in the group. Skills are also easier to improve than attributes. Skills are jotted down on character sheet two, included at the back of this book.

### Assigning Points to Skills
All the skills included in your chosen class begin at 1 for free. You can then use 10 points to increase these skills with 1 point per level (as you do spending Roleplaying Points).

> Tip: You may not raise a Skill of a higher Epoch higher than the Skills it depends on, see Skill Trees on page 6.

### Roleplaying and Skills
Skills should be used along with role-playing. Before rolling a for a skill, describe the action as best you can. A good description may make your gamesmaster lower the difficulty. 

If the skill involves haggling a deal, then try to barter with the gamesmaster. The gamesmaster is not looking for the best dealer in the world, just some effort in description as this effort adds richness to the game for everyone.

There are a few instances where lots of description should be done quickly - such as fast fire fights.

### Skill Epochs and Trees
Skills are organised into trees that grow from left to right. Here's the skill tree that begins with Grav Pilot (all the trees can be found in the Appendix).

XXX PICTURE - Pilot Skill tree

Every skill has an epoch. An epoch of 1 means that the skill does not depend on any other. For the example above, Grav Pilot does not depend on any other skill.

Skills of epochs 2 and above can only be bought after the skills of a lower epoch have been bought first. 
For example, Spacecraft Pilot requires Grav Pilot and Zero g Ops first.

A skill of a higher epoch cannot have a value larger than the lower epoch. 

For example, if Grav Pilot has a value of 3, Zero g Ops can only go as high as 3, it cannot be 4. If you have Zero g Ops at 3 and you want to raise it, you must raise Grav Pilot to 4 first.

### Skills Example: John Smith
Now we add skills to our example character, John Smith. The class we chose at the start was Scavenger Engineer. All these skills start with 1 point for free. 

We want John Smith to be really good with spacecraft. Spacecraft comes under Macromechanics (3rd Epoch). We will need to put points into Physics and Astromechanics too. We have 10 points to spend.

| Skill | Score |
|-------|-------|
| Law | 1 |
| History | 1 |
| Biology | 1 |
| Physics  | 1 + 3 = 4 |
| Zero-G Operations | 1 + 1 = 2 |
| Grav Pilot | 1 |
| Micro Engineering | 1 |
| Astromechanics | 1 + 3 = 4 |
| Macro Engineering | 1 + 3 = 4 |
| Artificial Intelligence | 1 |
| Hacking | 1 |

When flying an Orbihaul, John will be using Grav Pilot (1) with his Shift attribute (3). Having a skill of 1 means that he can fly fine but if he wants to do anything interesting then he will need to get to a target number of 12. He starts on 4 (3 + 1) so he needs 8 or more on a D10 to succeed.

When fixing the Botchery Clipper, John will be using Wit (4) and  Macro Engineering (4). When fixing something in a short amount of time or under stress, the target number will be 12 and as he starts on 8 (4 + 4), he only needs a 4 or more.

The skills are all found on the second character sheet.

## Step 5: Character Information
It is detail that brings a character to life and more interesting to play. Name, age, place of birth, class and an image. You do not have to be an artist to have a cool character image, instead plunder the internet!

### Name
This is the name of the character. It's best to choose a name from within your own culture. From a white, British perspective, names such as 'Adam Williamson', 'Simon Aubury' are common. 

Avoid using names of characters from films unless you want to parody that character. Within Human Occupied Space, people often have only one word for a name, feel free to experiment.

Akarakian names (if you are playing one) tend to have the syllable sounding 'ak' somewhere in the name. 
Zealot Akarakians often have 'ax' instead.

### Age
Better genetics and medicines mean a long life and over 90,000 years the human race has managed to nearly double the average life span of what it was in the 21st Century. 

Each setting and class will have recommended ages, experience is gained through living life, not necessarily getting older.

Age Comparison Table
| 21st Century Age | Icar - 921st Century Age | Description |
|------------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| 0 | 0 | Birth |
| 12 | 8 |Start of puberty |
| 18 | 12 |End of puberty |
| 21 | 18 |Physical peak |
| 26 | 50 |Onset of weight gain and 'middle aged spread' |
| 35 | 70 |Middle age (hair loss, etc.) |
| 40 | 85 |Greying hair |
| 65 | 110 |Retirement age |
| 75 | 140 |Average life expectancy |
| 85 | 150 |'Good' life expectance |
| 125 | 180 |Oldest non-augmented human |
| N/A | 320 |Oldest augmented human |

### Place of Birth
This depends on the setting that is being run. Within the setting, there will be a list of places that are eligible for your place of birth. The character's home will colour their point of view and experiences. Try and tie in the place of birth with your character concept. Place of birth does not affect race as there is only one race in the 93rd Millennium.

### Class and Setting
This is simply the name of the class the character is made from the setting document. The setting is the name of the campaign setting your GM is running. In John Smith's case, this is the Scavenger Setting.

## Step 6: Hit Points
This section determines the physical state of the character. Hit points is the amount of damage that your character can take before they are incapacitated. Incapacitated means that you need urgent medical attention or your character will die.

A human starts with 10 hit points.

### Starting with Bionics
If your character begins with bionics then the hit points will be set by the bionics.

## Step 7: Close Combat Combos XXXX
Close Combat Combos (combos) are chains of fighting manoeuvres that the character can perform. Although every character can punch and kick someone, to chain them together in a flow needs practise and the result of that practise is a close combat combo. 

The combos are written in the bottom right of the first character sheet. You can spend Roleplaying points (RP) to buy new combos. 

Combo building is covered in the Close Combat rules. XXXXXX

## Step 8: Roleplaying Points
Roleplaying points (RP) are awarded for roleplaying a consistent, believable character and for experiencing the world around them.

Roleplaying points are then spent to change the personality and improve attributes and skills.
It is quite normal for the Character you start with to be completely different in personality and strengths when you finish playing. 

RP is recorded on a disc on Character Sheet one underneath the Deviant Wheel. You might also like to keep a running total in this disc so that you can see how much you have spent on your character in the campaign.
When To Spend RP

Your Gamesmaster might decide to hand out RP at the end of the session or as the session is being played. Whenever the Gamesmaster gives you RP, you may spend it.

Roleplaying Point Uses

| Cost | Effect |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Alter as much of the Deviant Wheel as you please. This should be justified with the rest of the group and GM. For example, after you go through a harrowing ordeal. | 
| 1 | Buy a new Skill | 
| 1 | Increase a Skill by 1. See XXXXX |
| * | Buy a Combo, the cost is the same as the Combo difficulty. |
| * | Raise an Attribute. The cost is the new value of the Attribute. If your Attribute is 2 then to raise to 3, you must pay 3. |
| 10 | Choose an existing Psychotheatric and roll again on the table. You must accept the new Psychotheatric. |

## Step 10: Psychotheatrics
By now, the character has already taken shape, all that is left now is to add quirks of personality that are selected at random. Psychotheatrics are determined in the following way (and found in the Appendix).

1. The Player states how many Psychotheatrics are going to be added to the character. The player may choose up to three, no more. Up to three is number of the Psychotheatrics. 5 is right out. Once the number is decided, the player must stick with it.
1. The player rolls a D100 for each Psychotheatric in turn, dealing with each separately.
1. Any alterations to the deviant wheel or attributes are made at the end.

### Psychotheatrics and the Deviant Wheel
There may be cases where the Psychotheatric conflicts with the way in which the character's deviant was decided. In this case the Psychotheatric wins and the deviant wheel must be altered. If two Psychotheatrics are opposing then the earlier Psychotheatric is used and the second roll is to be re-rolled. No attribute may go below 1 but can be raised over the cap of 5.

The Psychotheatric is there to pour colour onto the character and give complacent players a challenge.
Weaving the Tale

The Psychotheatrics should fit into the background the character has. A certain amount of weaving or fitting in must be done make the Psychotheatric work. The gamesmaster should read the Psychotheatric before reading it out to the player. Some of the information is the Psychotheatric may need to be withheld from the player.

If the gamesmaster feels a Psychotheatric would break the character (especially given the setting) then they should ask them to re-roll.

Do not be worried if you roll poorly, you can buy off Psychotheatrics (see below) and it can be great fun to play a character with truly terrible Psychotheatrics. Before you spend RP, give it your best shot.

### Buy off Psychotheatrics
Psychotheatrics can be replaced by spending 10 RP. Choose the Psychotheatric you no-longer want and roll D100 for a new one.  You have to take a new one if you are buying off an old one. You keep the Attribute and Skill affects of the previous Psychotheatric but not the flavour text.

This should not be done lightly. The mental affect or problem represented by the Psychotheatric must be accounted for in game. 

> Example: If you have the Hunted Psychotheatric then you must confront and stop the killer before buying it off. If you are a psychopath, then you must go through psychotherapy or live through a life-changing event to change your psyche.
