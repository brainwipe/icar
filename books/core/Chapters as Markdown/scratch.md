# Core Rules Scratch
This file contains pieces that I have cut from the core rules, which are still canon and correct but don't really belong in a slimmed down book. It's an old writer's adage to never throw anything away. However, clipping need to be organised if they are going to be useful at all, that's what I hope to do here.

All snippets are organised by their topic.

# Droids
## Evolution
The emergence of the factions within the Droids does highlight another of their weaknesses, that they do evolve over time. There is a possibility that some factions may evolve into a nonviolent race. 

# Imperium
Living in the Imperial Crescent in Remmar is favoured because of the prosperity assumed by the proximity to power. The evidence of whether this is true is thin.

## Star Enforcers
The Star Enforcers (or simply The Enforcers) replaced a corrupt and under resourced interstellar police force (called the FEDS). Utilising their own fleet and resources, The Enforcers are able to keep excellent law and order on Colonies and in space around them. 

You might assume that with such advanced technologies comes the benefit of being able to tie criminals down with greater ease. However the Nexus requires the Star Enforcers to have huge amounts of evidence regarding the crime before a conviction can be made. This is because humans are fallible and any physical evidence (sensor footage, genetic information, sensor recordings in high tech buildings) can be forged. 

## Peers
The general public see their Peer as the ultimate problem solver as the Peer is normally required to solve large, system wide problems. A Peer visiting a colony can provide a massive economic boost alone.

### Crowell
Point out that she is Akarakian by stealth. Jacqueline is a softening of the common Akarakian hard 'ak' sound.

# Clusters


## Akar Cluster
The Akar Cluster was first settled in 4002 by Jebediah Akarak. Jebediah believed that to lead a long and healthy life both Mind and Body must be expanded and pursued. The first colonies starved as the colonies split their time evenly between encouraging their mind state and doing duties on the farms. This lead to many harsh winters where hundreds died through starvation. The food that was grown barely fed the populace, so little trade was possible. The cluster was quickly populated by people of the Akarak nation (many took surnames with 'AK' to show their affiliation) and slowly the wealth and power of these odd-ball people began to grow. This growth was massively aided by the Akarak Aid Fleet whose job it was to stop colonies from dying out.

Now the cluster is a thriving trade source as well as cultural centre. The strict Akarakian discipline lends itself well to trade as outside traders fell that the deal that they were getting will always be honest and fair.  The details of the Akarak nation are given later in the section Akarak Nation on page 60.

## Baleris Cluster
Situated on the border between Sayshell and Dorian, the Baleris Cluster location has been disputed since the original pioneers landed on Zeff Orb in 6295. The Cluster was soon absorbed into the Akarak culture but took a slightly different spin on their ideals. Baleris was a cultural centre for Akarakians, allowing the Akarak people to have more freedom from the constraints of the Elder's wishes. Times soon changed and the colonies in Baleris moved away from the Akarak way of thinking, it has kept its cultural significance and its leading system Acerine Prime is a good example of a system with all the good aspects of Akarakian ideas. 

## The Imperial Crescent
Deep within the heart of Remmar, the Imperial Crescent is a cluster that resembles a crescent if viewed directly from above the Galactic axis. The Imperial Crescent was populated extremely quickly and is the home of the Empress, Star Scientifica and The Star Enforcers. The technology of the Imperial Crescent is second only to Arcturus (Star Fleet's home in the Turus Cluster) but is also the centre of art and humanitarian issues as well. 
Many of the Interstellar corporations moved their operation to The Crescent purely for the prestige of being in the same cluster as the Empress. Trade, as you would expect, is blisteringly high around the cluster. The cluster also has a industrial edge, it is responsible for the production a huge amount of food which serves less fortunate clusters around it. The Imperial Crescent is a shining example for the rest of the human race.

## Naggachef Cluster
This cluster exists within the Nagga and Chef nebulae, two massive clouds of gas which exist 5 light years apart, swallowing most of the cluster. The patchy sparseness of the nebulae (compared to other nebulae of similar size) allowed Colonies to grow where otherwise it would have been impossible. When Peter Nagga settled the first colony with his wife-to-be Gill Chef in the latter part of 5998, the colonists who had taken the gamble were quite cut off from the rest of humanity. Most traders would not venture into the Nagga or Chef nebulae for fear of collision. Once the nebulae were correctly charted, the systems became very popular indeed.

Naggachef contains many systems within its nebulae, most of these systems have many I class planets (some terraformed) and great, untapped natural resources. The cluster has two major systems Prem-Nagga, a huge I class planet with a massive farming industry and Prem-Chef, a medium I class planet with a huge tourist and pleasure industry. Those on any system within Naggachef are delighted by the 'Nebularis' or 'sky lights', the patterns in space made by the two swirling nebulae. Never do any of the systems have complete darkness, there is always a glow of red, green or blue.
Naggachef is the main food producing cluster in Sayshell, turning out enough food to feed a third of the population of Sayshell. Subsidiary industries include production and tourism. 

## Niopak Cluster
'Niopak Primus Retaris' was first landed upon by James 'Niopak' Trenchard in 6156, life was very hard there. The colonists who settled there were more idealistic dreamers than realists. Artisans, writers, poets and drifters soon settled the many inhabitable planets surrounding Primus. They were not well suited to building and defending a colony but even through harsh winters, the Colonies grew. When the Romar Cluster began links in 6211, the colonies in Niopak strengthened, without losing the artisan core that permeated all the systems.

Today, Niopak is a very wealthy cluster, known for its fashion and for creating new trends and often being the centre of attention in Sayshell. Although there is quite a frivolous side to the Niopak cluster, there is a basis of hard fashion industry to support it all. Any item of day to day living is made fashionable, from Gaiacards to sports cars. Non-essential, yet highly sought after gadgets and trinkets are also produced in large quantities. 

## Romar Cluster
Populated by Romar Smith in 6002, the founder only remained on the founding system (Romar Grand) for a space of five years. In those years, he managed to set up a self sufficient economy. He soon realised that the remaining systems around Romar Grand were ripe for the picking and squeezed Romar Grand for the resources for setting up more colonies around it. Later, he bored of colonisation, Romar began setting up trade links with the colonies. When Romar was 56, he had managed to populate 10 planets and was training his two sons (Andrew and Simon) all that he had learnt. The Romar Cluster is now the most powerful economic cluster in Human Occupied Space.

Romar's strength is in its excellent adaption to changing needs. When Dorian opened, industry in Romar shrank, so they built extensive space docks to meet the demand for space craft. Currently, the Romar Cluster is gearing up to produce Orb Orbitals - huge space stations. Romar is often referred to as a 'Nomadic' Cluster as most of the cluster's inhabitants are traders who do not tend to spend too long in one place.

## Tef Cluster
Settled in 4142 by Norman Teffralliage (Tef), the Tef cluster is by far the most notorious and disreputable cluster in Imperial space. Within the Tef systems there are two sets of laws. The first set is Imperial Law, by which any respectable person goes by. 'Fralliage' law is the widely adopted law based on the principle 'You can do what you like if no-one is watching'. 

Corruption, theft, political overthrow are common place in Tef. However, people still enjoy living there because it is out from under the thumb of the Imperium while still remaining inside the safety of the Light Jump net. Tef also includes a very high percentage of I class planets (about 40%!), Although most of the climates are very harsh on those living there, they do still count as I class. 

## The Turus Cluster
Since the The Star Fleet was first created as Stella Fleet in 5800, the Turus Cluster (1 on the Sayshell Guide) has been its home. Boasting the largest colonies and Orbitals (space stations), the Turus Cluster is the centre of technology and learning. The Turus Cluster produces enough food to trade excess; training and spacecraft for the Fleet. Its excellent central position leaves it open to trade from the other Sectors and is by far the most advanced Cluster in Human Occupied Space. 

## Vitero Cluster
The 'Blue World' colony was founded in 6322 by Simon Vitero, from whom the Cluster takes its name. The ideals that the colony founded itself on were based within practicality. In the early years of colonisation, Vitero and his colleagues did well by saving time and effort for that which was absolutely necessary. The technological and agricultural output of the Blue World colony and the colonies that followed were excellent while the sociological advancements were minimal in the extreme.

Today, the Cluster still thrives on its principles of function rather than form. It is no surprise that the Mex building was designed here along with the laser-bladed harvester. Vitero also holds the headquarters of the Endotech shipwrights, along with a massive spacecraft manufacturing trade. The general public have little interest in visiting Vitero, which leaves its tourist trade dead and social colour bland.

## Earth, Sol System
Earth is the 3rd planet in the Sol system and the origin of humanity. After the rapid expansion of the human race, Earth become forgotten as it was a painful reminder of the horrors of war and the human race's barbaric past. Explorers often go looking for the location of Earth but never turn anything up. Most believe that Earth is now within Droid Space and not worth the risk looking for it.

The Imperium do not actively stop people looking for Earth but at the same time, they do not promote it. The Imperium claim that they do not know where Earth is, a favourite topic for conspiracy theorists.
