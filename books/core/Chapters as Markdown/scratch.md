# Core Rules Scratch
This file contains pieces that I have cut from the core rules, which are still canon and correct but don't really belong in a slimmed down book. It's an old writer's adage to never throw anything away. However, clipping need to be organised if they are going to be useful at all, that's what I hope to do here.

All snippets are organised by their topic.

# Droids
## Evolution
The emergence of the factions within the Droids does highlight another of their weaknesses, that they do evolve over time. There is a possibility that some factions may evolve into a nonviolent race. 

# Imperium
Living in the Imperial Crescent in Remmar is favoured because of the prosperity assumed by the proximity to power. The evidence of whether this is true is thin.

## Star Enforcers
The Star Enforcers (or simply The Enforcers) replaced a corrupt and under resourced interstellar police force (called the FEDS). Utilising their own fleet and resources, The Enforcers are able to keep excellent law and order on Colonies and in space around them. 

You might assume that with such advanced technologies comes the benefit of being able to tie criminals down with greater ease. However the Nexus requires the Star Enforcers to have huge amounts of evidence regarding the crime before a conviction can be made. This is because humans are fallible and any physical evidence (sensor footage, genetic information, sensor recordings in high tech buildings) can be forged. 

## Peers
The general public see their Peer as the ultimate problem solver as the Peer is normally required to solve large, system wide problems. A Peer visiting a colony can provide a massive economic boost alone.

### Crowell
Point out that she is Akarakian by stealth. Jacqueline is a softening of the common Akarakian hard 'ak' sound.

# Clusters


## Akar Cluster
The Akar Cluster was first settled in 4002 by Jebediah Akarak. Jebediah believed that to lead a long and healthy life both Mind and Body must be expanded and pursued. The first colonies starved as the colonies split their time evenly between encouraging their mind state and doing duties on the farms. This lead to many harsh winters where hundreds died through starvation. The food that was grown barely fed the populace, so little trade was possible. The cluster was quickly populated by people of the Akarak nation (many took surnames with 'AK' to show their affiliation) and slowly the wealth and power of these odd-ball people began to grow. This growth was massively aided by the Akarak Aid Fleet whose job it was to stop colonies from dying out.

Now the cluster is a thriving trade source as well as cultural centre. The strict Akarakian discipline lends itself well to trade as outside traders fell that the deal that they were getting will always be honest and fair.  The details of the Akarak nation are given later in the section Akarak Nation on page 60.

## Baleris Cluster
Situated on the border between Sayshell and Dorian, the Baleris Cluster location has been disputed since the original pioneers landed on Zeff Orb in 6295. The Cluster was soon absorbed into the Akarak culture but took a slightly different spin on their ideals. Baleris was a cultural centre for Akarakians, allowing the Akarak people to have more freedom from the constraints of the Elder's wishes. Times soon changed and the colonies in Baleris moved away from the Akarak way of thinking, it has kept its cultural significance and its leading system Acerine Prime is a good example of a system with all the good aspects of Akarakian ideas. 

## The Imperial Crescent
Deep within the heart of Remmar, the Imperial Crescent is a cluster that resembles a crescent if viewed directly from above the Galactic axis. The Imperial Crescent was populated extremely quickly and is the home of the Empress, Star Scientifica and The Star Enforcers. The technology of the Imperial Crescent is second only to Arcturus (Star Fleet's home in the Turus Cluster) but is also the centre of art and humanitarian issues as well. 
Many of the Interstellar corporations moved their operation to The Crescent purely for the prestige of being in the same cluster as the Empress. Trade, as you would expect, is blisteringly high around the cluster. The cluster also has a industrial edge, it is responsible for the production a huge amount of food which serves less fortunate clusters around it. The Imperial Crescent is a shining example for the rest of the human race.

## Naggachef Cluster
This cluster exists within the Nagga and Chef nebulae, two massive clouds of gas which exist 5 light years apart, swallowing most of the cluster. The patchy sparseness of the nebulae (compared to other nebulae of similar size) allowed Colonies to grow where otherwise it would have been impossible. When Peter Nagga settled the first colony with his wife-to-be Gill Chef in the latter part of 5998, the colonists who had taken the gamble were quite cut off from the rest of humanity. Most traders would not venture into the Nagga or Chef nebulae for fear of collision. Once the nebulae were correctly charted, the systems became very popular indeed.

Naggachef contains many systems within its nebulae, most of these systems have many I class planets (some terraformed) and great, untapped natural resources. The cluster has two major systems Prem-Nagga, a huge I class planet with a massive farming industry and Prem-Chef, a medium I class planet with a huge tourist and pleasure industry. Those on any system within Naggachef are delighted by the 'Nebularis' or 'sky lights', the patterns in space made by the two swirling nebulae. Never do any of the systems have complete darkness, there is always a glow of red, green or blue.
Naggachef is the main food producing cluster in Sayshell, turning out enough food to feed a third of the population of Sayshell. Subsidiary industries include production and tourism. 

## Niopak Cluster
'Niopak Primus Retaris' was first landed upon by James 'Niopak' Trenchard in 6156, life was very hard there. The colonists who settled there were more idealistic dreamers than realists. Artisans, writers, poets and drifters soon settled the many inhabitable planets surrounding Primus. They were not well suited to building and defending a colony but even through harsh winters, the Colonies grew. When the Romar Cluster began links in 6211, the colonies in Niopak strengthened, without losing the artisan core that permeated all the systems.

Today, Niopak is a very wealthy cluster, known for its fashion and for creating new trends and often being the centre of attention in Sayshell. Although there is quite a frivolous side to the Niopak cluster, there is a basis of hard fashion industry to support it all. Any item of day to day living is made fashionable, from Gaiacards to sports cars. Non-essential, yet highly sought after gadgets and trinkets are also produced in large quantities. 

## Romar Cluster
Populated by Romar Smith in 6002, the founder only remained on the founding system (Romar Grand) for a space of five years. In those years, he managed to set up a self sufficient economy. He soon realised that the remaining systems around Romar Grand were ripe for the picking and squeezed Romar Grand for the resources for setting up more colonies around it. Later, he bored of colonisation, Romar began setting up trade links with the colonies. When Romar was 56, he had managed to populate 10 planets and was training his two sons (Andrew and Simon) all that he had learnt. The Romar Cluster is now the most powerful economic cluster in Human Occupied Space.

Romar's strength is in its excellent adaption to changing needs. When Dorian opened, industry in Romar shrank, so they built extensive space docks to meet the demand for space craft. Currently, the Romar Cluster is gearing up to produce Orb Orbitals - huge space stations. Romar is often referred to as a 'Nomadic' Cluster as most of the cluster's inhabitants are traders who do not tend to spend too long in one place.

## Tef Cluster
Settled in 4142 by Norman Teffralliage (Tef), the Tef cluster is by far the most notorious and disreputable cluster in Imperial space. Within the Tef systems there are two sets of laws. The first set is Imperial Law, by which any respectable person goes by. 'Fralliage' law is the widely adopted law based on the principle 'You can do what you like if no-one is watching'. 

Corruption, theft, political overthrow are common place in Tef. However, people still enjoy living there because it is out from under the thumb of the Imperium while still remaining inside the safety of the Light Jump net. Tef also includes a very high percentage of I class planets (about 40%!), Although most of the climates are very harsh on those living there, they do still count as I class. 

## The Turus Cluster
Since the The Star Fleet was first created as Stella Fleet in 5800, the Turus Cluster (1 on the Sayshell Guide) has been its home. Boasting the largest colonies and Orbitals (space stations), the Turus Cluster is the centre of technology and learning. The Turus Cluster produces enough food to trade excess; training and spacecraft for the Fleet. Its excellent central position leaves it open to trade from the other Sectors and is by far the most advanced Cluster in Human Occupied Space. 

## Vitero Cluster
The 'Blue World' colony was founded in 6322 by Simon Vitero, from whom the Cluster takes its name. The ideals that the colony founded itself on were based within practicality. In the early years of colonisation, Vitero and his colleagues did well by saving time and effort for that which was absolutely necessary. The technological and agricultural output of the Blue World colony and the colonies that followed were excellent while the sociological advancements were minimal in the extreme.

Today, the Cluster still thrives on its principles of function rather than form. It is no surprise that the Mex building was designed here along with the laser-bladed harvester. Vitero also holds the headquarters of the Endotech shipwrights, along with a massive spacecraft manufacturing trade. The general public have little interest in visiting Vitero, which leaves its tourist trade dead and social colour bland.

## Earth, Sol System
Earth is the 3rd planet in the Sol system and the origin of humanity. After the rapid expansion of the human race, Earth become forgotten as it was a painful reminder of the horrors of war and the human race's barbaric past. Explorers often go looking for the location of Earth but never turn anything up. Most believe that Earth is now within Droid Space and not worth the risk looking for it.

The Imperium do not actively stop people looking for Earth but at the same time, they do not promote it. The Imperium claim that they do not know where Earth is, a favourite topic for conspiracy theorists.

# Colonies


# Colonies
A colony is the name given to a dwelling on or under the surface of a planet. A colony can be a city (called a Mex city) or high tech farming communities (called Crofts) or a combination of those. Colonies are normally set up on planets where there is a gravity strength appropriate to humans (around 1 earth gravity) although some colonies use spacecraft technology to provide a bubble of artificial gravity. A quarter of the human race live in space stations, called Orbitals but they are not considered to be colonies.

## Where Colonies Grow
Wherever there is a need for people to live, there will a be Colony. Colonies are built on planet surfaces (Prosurface), under the surface (Subsurface) or under oceans (Subaqua).

### Prosurface
Any colony on a planet where the air is nontoxic to humans is a Prosurface colony. Roughly 60% of colonies are Prosurface colonies. Earth in the 21st Century was a Prosurface colony.

### Subsurface
Any colony where the atmosphere is not breathable is called a Subsurface colony. These colonies are normally huge caverns buried deep within the surface of the crust, sealed to the harmful atmosphere. Within these caverns are cities, much the same as on Prosurface planets. Access to the colony is through many huge circular tunnels called 'vents'.

### Subaqua
Any colony built under an ocean of liquid (not necessarily water) is a Subaqua colony. Subaqua colonies are Cities built on the inside of giant spheres. Gravity in the spheres points toward the nearest inside face. All the buildings reach into the middle of the sphere. The large spheres are interconnected using a system of tunnels. Spacecraft dock on the outside of the spheres - space inside is usually too precious.

## Colony Buildings
The Droid War turned the human race into a race of refugees. A tsunami of people flooded from invaded Sectors into Sayshell. At first, they lived in repurposed spacecraft but those craft were soon needed to help other refugees and spark off trade. The Imperium responded with prefabricated buildings. 

There are two main types of building: Crofts and Mex Cities. Crofts are smaller buildings, made to house farms and holiday homes. Mex Cities are huge lattice structures with tall, straight buildings connected together with structural walkways, providing strength. Mex cities are by far the most popular buildings as they are cheap, very quick to construct and do not take up much of a footprint.

## Colony Council
Administration of the Colony is performed by the Colony Council. The Council is democratically elected every 4 years. Councillors are drawn from the wealthy, famous or purely on merit. The positions on the Council are: Chair, Industry, Treasury, Trade and Domestic. Two extra seats are appointed by the Imperium: Star Enforcer Captain in Charge and Star Civilisation Captain in Charge. Some councils have extra members depending on their local situation - such as a council member for Mining activities.

Councillors can serve as many terms as required and each Councillor is given a budget from the Imperium (via Taxes) and employs a staff. The taxes are used by the Council to grow the colony, provide services, perform maintenance on the infrastructure, subsidise trade negotiations and support flagging industries. Council Staffers wield much of the Council's power as negotiators and advisers to the Councillors.

The Council are constantly in the public eye, their decisions having real and often immediate affects on the population of the colony. Although there are no party affiliations, councillors often hold onto Human philosophies, by which they make their decisions (see Philosophy on page 59).

To understand, gain connections and make use of a colony's council, an Ecopolitical skill check is required.

### Chair
The Council Chair has the job of keeping order and making sure people do as they say they are going to do. The Chair is the public face of the colony and spends a lot of the day travelling around the reaches of the colony talking to people and investigating problems that might have been raised on a council meeting.

### Treasurer
The Treasurer is responsible for ensuring that the colony remains within its budget and that the Imperium is warned before they run out of money. Taxes are collected automatically by the Imperium over Gaia and the enforcement of tax collection is down to the Star Enforcers. Therefore, the Treasurer's budget is derived straight from an allowance from the Imperium.

More enterprising Treasurers will seek to boost this income with donations from wealthy people and corporations, although this is not expected of them.

### Industry
The aim of the Industry is to ensure that local businesses are supported and that there is fair competition on planet. The Industry Councillor also aids local businesses (using a budget) to help grow new industries or save important ones that are floundering.

# Mex

In Mex cities, there are many ways of travelling. Inside buildings, people travel by foot, to move up and down the buildings are extremely fast lifts that can traverse hundreds of floors in seconds. Free transport is provided in all Mex cities by the Free Mass-Transportation System (FEMTS) which are large bullet-shaped Grav vehicles that run methodical routes around the cities. Personal transport is provided by Grav Cars and Grav bikes which are flying vehicles that travel between the buildings.

## Lifts
run on Grav and are not directly to connected to the building, so there are many (often as many as 200) lifts in one building corner. 

They are best thought of as independent Grav Vehicles that mainly travel vertically. Lifts travel at great speeds and one can travel at up to 20 meters per second (4 floors a second or 12 floors a game turn). Each lift has a powerful gravity field generator that keeps the occupants safe from the affects of huge accelerations. Lifts can pass each other in a corner, allowing lifts to overtake each other.

## Traffic

For those who can afford their own personal transport, there are flying cars called Grav cars are used to move people around. As the volume of traffic in central areas of a city can be extremely heavy, people often choose to walk instead of driving.
Grav Cars fly through the city in lanes. Flying through the Mex City can be quite stressful to do at speed, so most people will switch on the Grav Car artificial intelligence and let it drive for them - picking the quickest route. An artificial intelligence will not break any driving laws and for those who want to dash through the City, they can drive on Manual (Pilot Grav skill check).

# Jobs in space

Travellers are often grouped by the job that they perform. Most regular travellers through space operate as part of a crew on a star craft. Although the particular jobs on each craft are varied - from medic through to pilot - the crew are normally classified by the job that the ship does. A few examples of these tasks are given below.

### Imperial
The Imperium has 2 separate fleets. The largest Fleet is operated by the Star Enforcers and is used by Star Enforcers, Star Civilisation and Star Scientifica. The craft are mostly used for chasing criminals and for dealing with Pirates. Not all of the Enforcer fleet is well armed and are a mix of purpose built and converted civilian craft. The other fleet, The Star Fleet, is purpose built and created from the very best technology the Imperium has to offer. The crews are all Fleet personnel and represent a complete fighting force from fighter pilots to soldiers (called Troopers).

### Trade
In this case, the term Trade is a very broad one. A craft that moves any item from A to B is considered a trade one. A trade vessel carries freight (raw materials or tech) or passengers.  Typically, a depicts the type of cargo it caries. 
For example, Ore freighters tend to be large and dirty, with large industrial automaton equipment. Tech traders tend to be smaller, high tech craft! The dynamics of space trade itself is dealt with later.

### Courier
A courier picks up an item from one client and delivers it to another. They are more expensive than traders but give a more personalised hand-to-hand service: important for expensive or personal items. A courier is a regular space traveller and will build up a clientele of corporate and non-corporate customers. Excellent service will build a good name and this is essential for a successful courier.

### Deep Space Scavenger Crew
There are billions of tonnes of abandoned treasure, and junk worth money. A Deep Space Scavenger's (Scavengers) job is to find, repair and return for sale. Seen as the lowest of the low when it comes to ship crews, Scavengers spend their time in dangerous wrecks, hunting out cargo and objects of value. 

Within these floating shipwrecks could be any manner of dangers, from traps rigged by paranoid crew members on leaving the wreck to other Scavenger teams. The example setting pits you as one of these crews. See Scavenger Setting on page 97.

## Cost of Space Travel
Space Travel is cheap and available to the masses. There are nearly always spacecraft berths available, although it can be difficult finding a spacecraft on a direct route. In most cases, the traveller will change at a large terminus orbital.

## Light Jump

A jump lasts one hour. At the end of which, you can jump again. The jump is in a straight line (there is no such thing as a straight line as space is curved, but simplified for ease here). All jumps last one hour, the faster the ship is, the further you go. This is because the ship takes most of this hour to accelerate and the major part of the travelling is done in the last ten seconds. Thus, if a ship can go at 20 and needs only to jump 10, it will still take an hour. All of the calculations required to cover long distances are performed by an AI and thus the crew of the ship can rest or perform other tasks while the vessel is in transit.

### PTP

PTP requires more power, and cannot be fitted on very large craft. For large craft with PTP, the engine and generators for it take up most of the vessel. PTP is mostly found in small executive and charter vessels (as might be used by couriers in a hurry). PTP is also four times as expensive. This is not so much the future of space travel, more of an alternative present.

### Curve Surf
Because of the gradual acceleration offered by this surfing, the light jump bubble can be kept open indefinitely. A vessel using Curve Surf can also change direction in mid jump. 

As curve surf has a more accurate sensor pack and can change direction, it is less susceptible to time-space faults. Also, Curve Surfing can begin from anywhere in System Space.

The largest difference between Curve Surf and typical light jump Engines is that the speed of Curve Surf depends on the pilot. In light jump Engines, it does not matter what part of space you're flying through, the distance you travel given in one hour has a maximum. Curve Surf depends on the ability of the pilot to intelligent plot routes through space. This can be achieved by an AI, but the nuances of space an human flair will always achieve better results. Thus, for each ship equipped with Curve Surf, two light jump speed are provided: one if a Pilot Cruiser Skill check is successful and one if it is not. 


### Typical Craft Systems
Spacecraft vary in technology widely from the basic freighter to the most expensive executive cruiser. There are some basic systems that are found on most craft. 

_Typical Craft Systems_

| System | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Hull | Able to withstand the shock of meteor collisions. |
| Generators | Huge power sources from which all power on the craft derives. The fuel they use lasts for thousands of years. |
| Life Support | Air, food and waste processing for indefinite survival. |
| Grav Engines | Sub-light speed travel and also for the gentle push in a light jump. |
| Light Jump Engines | Engines used for moving between systems and clusters. |
| Energy Web | The power distribution system around the craft. |
| Sensors | Mostly used for detection of collisions and for avoiding space-time faults. |
| Grav Field Generator | Creates an artificial gravity on the ship. Can be localised to allow any surface to be walked on. |
| Grav Lock | A device for keeping the atmosphere 'in' where the hull has holes (airlocks and breeches). |
| Shields | An energy based defence that can be turned on and off. Invisible to the human eye. |
| Cargo Bay | A space for stacking crates. |

## The Dynamics of Trade
Trade is the movement of resources from one system to another for money and happens for three reasons. 

### Obliged Trade Routes
An obliged trade route is where a colony council contracts a 

Firstly, trade occurs because a system requires a certain resource to continue operating. For example, a sub-surface colony may need a supply of oxygen. This is called an obliged trade route. Failure to complete this route can mean a fine, legal action and even a banning of spacecraft use. 

Secondly, a trade route may exist between two planets where there is mutual benefit. In one direction there may be flow of food and water from an inhabited planet and in the other direction technology from a planet strong on manufacture. These routes are controlled by the Councils on the planets and are sold to particular traders to operate them. No one else may run that cargo on that route unless there is an increase in demand. This is called a secured trade route.

Finally, a trade route between two systems where there is profit to be had. This is a more traditional route and they make up 80% of the total number of routes. These are called free trade routes.

## Space Travel Facts and Figures
- A light jump takes 1 Hour.
- A ship's light jump speed gives the number of cluster squares travelled in a single jump.
- A cluster can be considered to be 20 cluster squares across.
- A craft must be 1 hour outside the system (outermost planet) before it can light jump.
- On Grav, it takes 1 hour to travel between planets.
- On Grav, it takes 10 minutes to travel between a planet and a moon.
- Unless otherwise stated by the spacecraft sheet, it takes 4 hours to go from Low Orbit to the planet surface.
- From Low to High Orbit takes a very small amount of time and can be ignored.

# Gaia
The name Gaia used to refer to 'Mother Earth', a mystical being that protected the human race's original home, Earth. Such romantic mysticism has long since died and Gaia is now known as the computer network that the human race uses to communicate.

Created during The Droid War, Gaia is a huge virtual world that mimics the real world as well as the creators will let it. As the technology was created after the war had started, the Droids cannot use it. It exists within Imperium space, outside of which there is no Gaia at all. A detailed description of Gaia is included in the Technology section. A brief overview for the casual user is included here.



Gaia can be accessed for free by anyone. There are millions of cylindrical public terminals everywhere. 

Upon stepping into a Gaia terminal, the person is standing in the virtual world of Gaia. From there, the user can navigate around - visiting the Gaia representations of the real world anywhere in the Imperium without physically moving location. In large cities, these representations are likely to be more impressive than the real world counterparts. 


Anything that has a Rayengine (computer chip) appears on Gaia, the shape of the real world object hard-wired into the Gaia version (with one exception - the hand-held terminal. See below)

## Active and Passive Gaia
Gaia is used in two ways. Active Gaia allows you to run your own intelligent software, called Entities. Passive allows you to do everything but use your own Entities.

### Passive Gaia
Using a public terminal without your own Entities running is known as passive Gaia and is how the majority of people use it. Using Gaia passively allows you to interact on the very basic level: watching news or sports, buying products (by exchanging money) or meeting friends in a distant Cluster. When you use Gaia passively you look exactly like you do in the real world.

> Example: To make a call to a friend, you step into a terminal and give the name and location of the person you want to speak to. Gaia will perform a simple search to find them and then zip you to their location. Your physical body has not moved but the 3D Gaia projection will have changed to the world where your friend lives.

### Active Gaia

Active Gaia requires the ownership of a Gaiacard (sometime called a Gaiacard in slang). A Gaiacard has a toolkit and an individual and unique identity called an Isis. This Isis is represented as a shape. You may have an Isis that looks different to yourself (such as a Dragon or giant robot) although it is not considered chic or adult to do so. A Gaiacard also allows you to have your own set of controls, such as personalised driving controls for your car or a set of hacking tools for getting into other people's systems. Most people make do without one, though. A few people have the terminal and Gaiacard installed in their head (see Bionics Section). This makes them very powerful Gaia users. One of the Gaiacard tools of interest is the ability to lock a terminal.

### Immersive terminals

Immersive terminals are those where the terminal surrounds you, like the public Gaia terminals. Most people will have an immersive Gaia terminal in their apartment or Croft house. 
Tanked Gaia is where a portal terminal is used to contact Gaia. Portable terminals are mostly used for quick calls, checking sports scores or sending messages. It is more difficult to ensure that the Gaia call is kept private.
For those with Gaia bionics, all interactions with Gaia is immersive, even when they are light years from the nearest terminal.

### Psychological Effects
A Gaia terminal reproduces reality perfectly: sights, forces, smells and sounds are not differentiable from the real world. The AI controlling the terminal will not let harm come to you. The only thing that stops you from believing that you are in reality is a psychological effect called Reality Gravity. This is a feeling that something is not entirely right. It can be suppressed for a few days, but after that it is clear that something is not right. There are those people that believe that Gaia is more real than the real world - often leaving their bodies to rot in the real world as they experience a massive galaxy of soap operas, shopping, other people, news, features, history documentaries and more.


### Hard Light
The technology that allows people to interact with this virtual world is called Hard Light. Hard Light is a technology where a hologram can apply a force. There is a limit to how much force it can apply but these complex objects can be used to fool the senses. A Hard Light table can be made to feel like wood, glass, water or wind. Being in Gaia, the laws of physics need to be obeyed but the table can be made to act as the artist wants. Hard Light objects can exist in Gaia rooms or within the projection sphere of a Tanked terminal. The act of these objects appearing is called 'rezzing'.

### Generic and Unique Hard Light
Hard Light objects can be generic or unique. A generic object may be copied within Gaia but a unique object is exactly that - no copies may be made.

Like any piece of art, the cost of a Hard Light object depends on the artist, its rarity, its complexity and fashion. Unlike real world objects, they can be carried on any Gaiacard, and rezzed anywhere. In this way, people can carry all their home furniture around with them on their Gaiacard, literally taking their homes with them. Hard Light objects are bought and sold across Gaia.

Most rooms within the more modern colonies are immersive Gaia rooms: living rooms, bedrooms, cafes, medical facilities and shops. The furniture of these rooms are all Hard Light objects, most are generic. For high rent rooms, unique objects will be scattered around the generic ones.

### Entities

The most popular of all the Entities is the search Entity, that runs around the public spaces of Gaia finding out information given some search criteria. Once it has some information, it returns to where it was set (or around a list of places, looking for the Isis of the owner). You can search Gaia passively but the information tends to be rather superficial. A search Entity will make much better connections and provider more context to the information. In 21st Century terms, passive searching is using Google and adjusting search terms; In 921st Century terms, a search agent would be using Google even when your computer is switched off.

### Nexus
The Nexus is the central location for all Imperial information and is used by all of the Star Industries and Imperial Councils. The Nexus performs three roles: an information store, an information retriever and a judge.

This is the primary function of its intelligence. An Imperial worker can ask questions of the Nexus and a reply in the correct context will be given. By having a question and answer session with the AI, new connections between data (that requires the abstraction of human thought to make) can be forged. In this way, the Nexus learns from the humans that use it.

### Information retrieval

Not all information is available to everyone. Some parts of the Nexus have restricted access depending on the sensitivity of the information and who placed it in there. Details of Star Sci experiments, criminal records, Star Fleet battle orders and Imperium Law reviews are placed in their respective areas. Higher ranks tend to have better access although this is not accounted for across Star Industries.

The public areas of the Nexus are well frequented by those looking for the latest scientific developments, news on galactic economic trends and those requesting help with any matter.

### Hacking
 system is perfect and that can certainly be said for Gaia. It is possible to create Entities that exploit imperfections in Gaia and so gain access to areas that are otherwise hidden from the public view. 

Hacking within Gaia is done within the rules of Gaia. You cannot hack Gaia itself. Therefore, Hacking is about exploiting the cracks and imperfections caused by the creation of the virtual world.

The rules for Hacking can be found in Hacking on XXXXXXXX.

## Undergaia

The Undergaia is the illegal side of Gaia. Hidden in the corners and cracks of Gaia are people and Entities that avoid the rest of society. The virtual world of Gaia is not perfect, nor complete and in the places where the designers have not yet filled will often exist Undergaia. The Undergaia is not a single place, it's a collection of places across the virtual galaxy. 

The Undergaia began as secret meeting places for exchanging thoughts, rumour and information useful for those engaged in illegal activities. In modern times, it is so much more. The Isis belonging to criminals hide out in the Undergaia, using it as a safe place to start off their illegal Entities that often pass out into the rest of Gaia.

The Undergaia persists due to the huge market in stolen unique Entities and more simple Gaia objects. 

One way in which the Undergaia managed to avoid being used by the Enforcers as an inroad into the criminal world is by flooding the Undergaia information centres with false information. Unless you know how to move through the enormous amount of misinformation to the real information (the Hacking Skill can be used with Research to perform this function) then it can be difficult to find accurate answers to your questions.

### Accessing the Undergaia
The Undergaia can be accessed by passing a Hacking Skill check. A Hacking Skill check is then required for each piece of information that the character needs. It is not possible to 'bookmark' locations in the Undergaia, you must hack to find a new entry point even if you have been there before.

If the team does not have anyone with the Hacking Skill, then they must attempt to find someone who can access the Undergaia either by using contacts or by searching Gaia for people offering generic Gaia services, such as Information Brokers.

## Automatons
Perhaps the most controversial technology, Automatons are intelligent machines that live and work amongst the human race. There is an important distinction between robots, Droids and Automatons: a robot is an autonomous device with intelligence that can unwittingly harm humans (like a toaster), Droids are a type of artificially intelligent robot that are designed to destroy; Droids can kill. 

An Automaton is an artificially intelligent (AI) robot that has been hard-coded with laws serve to protect the human race. Furthermore, modern Automatons are programmed using Gaia and are therefore impervious to the reprogramming attempts of Droids.


### Classes
Automatons can be broadly split into classes. The class can indicate the types of job that the Automaton was designed for. Quite often an automaton is used for a job that they were not designed for but manage to do the task just as well.

_Humanoid._ The most common of Automaton. Human in shape and appearance, they are often created with unique personalities. To the human eye and touch, a Humanoid Automaton is indistinguishable from another human.

_Utility._ These Automatons are used in industry a great deal. Their form is normally an exaggerated humanoid and they quite often take the shape of Industrial Borgs. Utility Automatons are found on space docks and in mining operations.

_Singular._ This Automaton is normally constructed for a single purpose and is not used for much else. A good example are Hoppers: Automatons used for the sole purpose of moving space crates around.

### Automaton Jobs
Automatons perform many of the menial tasks that humans could do but choose not to. Their form is often derived from this shape. For example, most Automatons working within human colonies are aesthetically indistinguishable from humans. They work in a human world and interact with humans and so are constructed by them. However, Automatons that work in mines or on construction sites have metal skins and are created for that purpose. Other jobs include:

- Building cleaner
- Construction worker
- Corporate personal assistant
- Corporate receptionist
- Crate mover (called a Hopper)
- Customer sales staff
- Heavy lifter
- Housekeeper
- Miner
- Nanny
- Prostitute

### Ascension
Ascension is the process of an Automaton growing from AI Power 5 (Skilled) to AI Power 6 (Empathic). Ascension is a big deal from the point of view of the Automaton as it is the first step away from machine towards the individual. The act of moving from Power 5 to 6 is called Ascension. See Ascension on page XXXXX.

### Capping
AI Power is usually given an upper limit (capped). You would not want your mining Automaton becoming interested in music and human emotion, so you might cap it at 4. Most artificial intelligences that humans rely upon with their lives (such as spacecraft) are capped at level 5 to stop them from Ascending.

As the Automaton is Artificially Intelligent, it changes over time. The more it experiences, the more it learns, the more its personality changes from the original template. The original personality template normally fits the task that the Automaton is designed for. 

### Automatons and the Droids
There is a great deal of distrust of any form of robotics within society. Before The Droid War, every household throughout the galaxy had at least 2 automatons to clean, tend gardens and as companions. Industry was totally driven by automatons and ran all levels of production, administration and sale. Automatons were an integral part of society, within which humans were only needed for their inspiration and vision.

Many doom sayers spoke out about the dangers of allowing the proliferation and reliance on machines and yet no-one could envision a machine that could kill.

With the onset of the Droids, the automatons were reprogrammed within an instant and the human race was swamped by deadly machines. Most human casualties from the start of the war came from those automatons living within society, rather than those designed by Star Sci.

The minds of automatons built since the Droid War are created using Gaia and so are immune to the Droids but the hard lesson learnt by many colonies falling under their robot servants still rings loudly.

Before The Droid War, there were 2 Automatons for each human. Since the war, there is 1 Automaton for every 10. Where this balance is maintained, there is normally a general feeling of safety. However, on those systems where Automatons are required to keep the economy running (such as mining colonies), there is a distrust of them. Approximately 70% of the human race does not trust Automatons and might even ask them to leave the room. 30% of Systems have Automatons banned outright and 50% of public establishments ban Automatons too. These attributes are indicative of people's feelings towards them.

Due to The Droid War, there are very few Automatons that were created before 91001 and most of those are transferred across to a Gaia based system.
