# Core Rules Scratch
This file contains pieces that I have cut from the core rules, which are still canon and correct but don't really belong in a slimmed down book. It's an old writer's adage to never throw anything away. However, clipping need to be organised if they are going to be useful at all, that's what I hope to do here.

All snippets are organised by their topic.
