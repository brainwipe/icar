# Core Rules Scratch
This file contains pieces that I have cut from the core rules, which are still canon and correct but don't really belong in a slimmed down book. It's an old writer's adage to never throw anything away. However, clipping need to be organised if they are going to be useful at all, that's what I hope to do here.

All snippets are organised by their topic.

# Droids
## Evolution
The emergence of the factions within the Droids does highlight another of their weaknesses, that they do evolve over time. There is a possibility that some factions may evolve into a nonviolent race. 

# Imperium
Living in the Imperial Crescent in Remmar is favoured because of the prosperity assumed by the proximity to power. The evidence of whether this is true is thin.

## Star Enforcers
The Star Enforcers (or simply The Enforcers) replaced a corrupt and under resourced interstellar police force (called the FEDS). Utilising their own fleet and resources, The Enforcers are able to keep excellent law and order on Colonies and in space around them. 

You might assume that with such advanced technologies comes the benefit of being able to tie criminals down with greater ease. However the Nexus requires the Star Enforcers to have huge amounts of evidence regarding the crime before a conviction can be made. This is because humans are fallible and any physical evidence (sensor footage, genetic information, sensor recordings in high tech buildings) can be forged. 

## Peers
The general public see their Peer as the ultimate problem solver as the Peer is normally required to solve large, system wide problems. A Peer visiting a colony can provide a massive economic boost alone.
