Bionics
For some, humanity is not near enough to the top of the food chain. The human body and consciousness can be augmented by technology. Any unnatural augmentation of a human is known as the group term Bionics, regardless whether they are biological based or machine based improvements. The person with the augmentation is referred to as an Aug (Augmented Human) in this section. Bionics is split into three distinct sections. 
Borgware involves completely replacing limbs such that the Aug looks like part of a machine. Cyberware goes under the skin, sometimes replacing limbs but normally such that the enhancement does not change the appearance of the Aug. Bioware produces flesh and nerves that is woven onto the body of the Aug. It can change the appearance of the Aug, but rarely does. A more detailed description of each is included at the start of each section.
Impact on Humanity (Soul)
A Character�s Soul Attribute will drop with each augmentation that makes them notably less human. If the Character�s Soul reaches zero, you become a jabbering lunatic and the Character is taken over by the GM. This is why there are no Augs with spider bodies - the human mind cannot take the extreme loss of humanity.
Starting out with Bionics
There is a replacement for every part of the human body and this can be quite complicated to deal with. When choosing Bionics you can either go with a pre-made bionic suit, which is a package of different parts ready to use; or  become augmented Incrementally. You can reach the same state each way. Imcremental is more complicated but allows the most freedom to choose. For Systematic upgrades, any given system will require others to already be installed.
Installation and Repair
Installing the body upgrades is different for each type of augmentation but it generally goes through the cycle of:
1. Go to Star Civilisation hospital
2. Become unconscious
3. Placed in a machine
4. Body parts replaced
5. Wake up
6. Rehabilitate (see below)
Repair of Bionics is done using the Bionics Systems Skill (Medical). Borgware can be repaired using a standard Mech/Tech kit whereas Cyberware and Bioware requires the same machine that was used to install the augmentation (see Systems Repair on page 9). It is possible to fit different types of Bionic onto the same person, unless otherwise stated. A certain amount of common sense is required, if the Aug is a Full Borg with no skin left, then a skin tattoo is not possible. A failure of installation (failed Bionics Systems roll) leads to either a permanent Rehab or a longer Rehab time (GM choice).
Rehabilitation (Rehab)
Rehabilitation is what happens after you have been augmented. The greater its effect on the life of the Aug, the longer and more drastic the Rehab is. Rehab is normally much like physiotherapy (like you would have after breaking a leg in the 21st Century), a number of physical workouts, monitored by a qualified doctor (normally a suitably trained human-like Automaton or Gaia Entity). It can be painful and frustrating. If Rehabilitation is not undertaken then the Aug may pick up neurosis and may never fully recover from the augmentation process. 
Once rehabilitation is finished correctly, then the Aug will never have any trouble again. 
Bionics and the Law
All Bionics are registered with Star Civilisation upon installation. It is possible to get Bionics fitted without this registration, but it is illegal and can lead to a hefty fine and the doctor performing the installation will be sent to a penal colony. If an Aug is found performing crimes, their bionics are removed, or in the case of a Borg, the Aug is given a vastly underpowered suit that is recognised by all Bionics doctors and is illegal to upgrade. 
For those Augs performing violent crimes and murder, they are hooked up to a life support system and then �switched off� such that their brain is still awake and active but they cannot move or communicate with the outside world. Very few Borgs live more than a year in a switched off state.
Human Life Span
All bionics extend life span in some form or another. However, the human brain will eventually run out of steam at approximately 320 years, after a 5 year period of senility. The better the Bionics and the more attention to detail when Rehabilitating the longer the life span. The downside to this is that many of the bionics that allow extended life span will lead to the Aug becoming sterile at the age of around 50.
Social Effects
The largest drawback of bionics the adverse reaction of society toward you. The human race is prejudiced toward anyone with large scale augmentation. This social Characteristic is often manifested by fear, hatred or plain racism. Many systems have local laws that ban bionics over a certain level or to have a separate registration. This restriction is often argued as a infringements of rights, but then for most, Bionics is a choice. One might choose a physical upgrade but you also choose the social ramifications that accompany it. 
Borgs get the worst treatment as they look the least like humans and also that Borgs can no longer be a parent. This classes them lower in a society where keeping the human race going is the most important consideration. Those with Cyberware often appear as if they are underhanded and sneaky and thus not to be trusted. Most Bioware goes unnoticed, but then the enhancements it provides are minimal. 
Small cosmetic enhancements and fashion upgrades - although invasive - are not considered to be augmentations in the same way new limbs are. As such, many members of the general public will have small cosmetic upgrades.
Combat Bionics
Some bionics have features that enhance combat prowess. On the most simple level, these could be targeting modifiers that help the Aug fire weapons more accurately. There are also systems that allow an Aug to have a bonus in close combat. In this case, the bionics system will come with a close combat combo with a Battle Attribute modifier. This combo may be used in addition to the 8 combos the Character already has, however it can not be altered and must have the Battle modifier taken into account. The Combat Bionic combo may be longer than that allowed by the Character�s Battle. In this case, the player may still use the combat bionic combo because for the bionic Combo, it is the bionics doing the fighting, not the Aug.
Bionics Sheet
Immediately after a bionic augmentation, (regardless how small), you should update your Human / Armour card to a bionics one. This should be used to copy the information onto and gives a feeling of change that should be echoed in the Character.
Bionics in Play
It is the responsibility of the player to remember what systems they have installed and remind the GM at the appropriate time. With a team of 6 players, it can be very difficult for the GM to remember all the different systems and technology that all the players have installed. If you forget to include your augmentation after skill or attribute checks have been made then it is considered too late to utilise those systems. Keeping track of multiple systems is a more complicated form of play and may not be well-suited to beginner players.
Borgware
Of all the Bionics on offer, Borgware is the oldest and most understood. Bionics are favoured by many because of the longevity offered by replacing biological parts with easily serviced energy driven systems. Also, Borgware has the advantages of cost effective Augmentation and repair as well as a wide array of small systems that can upgrade a suit with little cost.
To Suit or Not To Suit
Borgs have a choice of becoming a Half Borg (Borg spine and a limb or two) or a Full Borg (full body replacement). Half Borgs are rare (Rarity: 90%) and tend only to be those people who have lost limbs through accident (or carelessness) and can not afford (or find) a Bioweave replacement.
Full Borgs are common and can be found in Heavy Industry, Sports and in Expeditionary teams (people who leave Human occupied space). Borgs are also widespread across the Imperium, especially in Star Fleet where human intelligence is required within the tough body of a machine. Thus, Borg suits can be classed as Military, Expeditionary, Industrial and Sport. Military suits can only be gained by active service in the Star Fleet and are not included here because of their rarity. All the others are readily available and their uses are listed below.
It is possible to add Borgware or Cyberware in stages (called Incremental Augmentation), allowing a gradual change from human to Augmented. The benefit of this is that there is less cost up front and also the chance of rejection is less. Furthermore, the rehabilitation time is spread out over a number of weeks so there is no need to take a month out. It does tend to take longer than just being suited initially and you don�t get all the bonuses at once but it might be more appropriate for the characters role in a team.
Expeditionary
The closest suit to a Military one, without actually being one. The expeditionary suit is intended for use outside of Imperium space: the Fringe and Lone Systems. Expeditionary suits tend to be fast, tough and well equipped for all environments. They are also the only suit that can come with weapons mounted as standard. Due to the high tolerances of construction, these suits are generally the most expensive.
Industrial
By far the most prevalent suit is the Industrial one. These suits are larger, stronger and equipped such that a person can do their job. Industrial suits are used in star docks, Space Ports and any hazardous environment where a human might need to wear an environment suit. The suits tend to be large and bulky. Due to the large numbers in which these suits are produced, they tend to be the cheapest.
Sports
The sports industry took hold of Borg and Cyberware as soon as it realised the athletes would do anything to get an edge on their sport. These suits come in all sorts of variants, mostly designed for a particular sport. There is a �generic� sub-type. This is for those people who either like to think they are a true athlete or wish to have the longevity without the cost of an Expeditionary suit or the bulk of an Industrial. The cost of these suits tends to vary depending on the application they are put to use but they can be extremely expensive indeed.
Borgware Augmentation & Rehabilitation
The Augmentation process for Borgware is performed using a semi-automated laser surgeon where the brain is removed from the skull of the Aug while immersed in a biogenetic fluid. The brain is then laced with the Rayengine Link (Rink) and inserted into the Borg suit. Connections are then made with the suit and the Rehab process begins.
The whole Augmentation process between the user becoming unconscious and being immersed in the fluid and then waking up as a Borg is 20 minutes. The process is a refined and well understood one. Thus it requires an Easy Bionics Systems Skill check to perform. Few people reject Borg Augmentation but if they do, they can be rejoined with their old body and the scarring removed. 
Rehabilitation
Borgware rehabilitation is difficult for the Aug. The Human brain does not react well to being put into an unfamiliar host for the first time. The first 40 hours of consciousness normally involve convulsions and a fair amount of pain for the Aug. From there, the Aug must learn to walk and perform other dexterous tasks. The further from humanity the suit is, the more time it takes to adjust. After Rehab is finished, it is expected for there to be some additional training, which can be self-taught. Rehabilitation supervision requires a Bionics Systems check.
Repair and Upgrading
Borgware is most useful when it comes to upgrading or adding to the suit. It does not require a fully qualified medic and large amounts of equipment, like other Bionics.
Requirements for Repair or Upgrades:
Bionics Systems Roll (Easy)
Bionics Know and Mechasys Systems Skill check.
Thus, you do not have to be a qualified medic to be able to update Borg Systems.
Cyberware
The most desirable technology to come from the Aran War is Cyberware (Cyber). Cyberware allows a person to become augmented to strengths equalling the Borgs without losing human form in the process. This is done by replacing some organs, bones and muscles under the skin without changing the skin at all. Cyberware is a marriage between technology and biology, being able to create a machine that can symbiotically interacts with the host (the Aug). Unlike Borgware, a full suit of Cyberware maintains skin, hair and many other glands.
Cyberware Classification
Cyberware can be split once again into different types. The main two are Hardwire and Wetwire. Hardwire Cyberware are those things that replace human systems. This can be in full (Full Body Replacement) or in part (an artificial liver). It is very rare for a person to just replace a single limb. Wetwire Cybernetics tends to be additions to the human form, such as animated tattoos or a Rayengine Link. Wetwire tends to have much sorter (or even negligible) rehabilitation times, unlike Hardwire. There are places where crossover does occur, in this case they are counted as Hardwire. Due to cost, Hardwire Cyber is much less common than Wetwire.
The types of Cyberware suit are Military, Expeditionary, Industrial and Sports. These classifications are exactly the same as in the Borgware section. Unlike Borgware, Industrial Cyberware is quite difficult to come by as a Cyberware suit is not as cost effective and versatile as a Borg one.
Cyberware Augmentation
Augmenting under the skin without damage requires specialist technology and is more difficult than Borgware. Although the technology is well developed and understood, the process demands many small adjustments, which makes the duration more difficult to predict. Before augmentation, the suit or device needs to be configured to match the genetic code of the Aug. This requires the technology of the Cyberware to be much more carefully constructed and malleable to the demands of the Aug, such as height and build adjustment.
Cyberware augmentation two different processes, often happening concurrently. They are called the Cyber Razor Cut (CRC) machine and Nanobiogenetics (NBG). CRC and NBG installation requires the right equipment and a successful Bionics Systems roll for each of the processes (if both are required).
Cyber Razor Cut (CRC)
The CRC machine is a chair in which the Aug sits, much like a 21st Century Dentist chair. The chair is set in a hyper-accurate beaming field. On another chair is the Cyberware (suit or device). The subject is made unconscious and the suit is beamed from its chair into the Aug while the internals of the Aug are beamed into a biotank for storage. The swap for biological to technical is simultaneous. The organs are usually sold as part of the cost of Augmentation. The whole process takes approximately 5 minutes.
Nanobiogenetics (NBG)
These highly specialized nanites are designed to perform specific alterations to the Aug. NBG is used extensively in the joining of Cyber suit and Aug body (especially in linking up the suit and the skin). NBG nanotechnology is comprised of hundreds of tiny robots which are programmed to work together for a single purpose, typically to install an augmentation. Once complete, the nanites biodegrade within the Aug�s blood system and are flushed out in urine. 
NBG is applied by injection through a medical energy hypodermic injector (like a needle but without piercing the skin). Any materials required for the creation of the structures are inserted using a CRC machine. The Aug must remain within a huge cylindrical sensor field while the NBG can do its work. Depending on the task being performed, NBG may work between 5 minutes to 60 hours, to completion.
Usually, the CRC and NBG machines are combined together in a single facility. This single Cyberware facility is called a Cybershock.
Cyberware Rehabilitation
Much like Borgware, the amount of Rehabilitation depends on the level of augmentation. Large changes in physical attributes (Attributes) or persona (looks) will extend the time of Rehab. Rehab, much like Borgware, involves learning to walk and operate again. The first 40 hours is always the worst with convulsions, frequent bilious attacks and loss of consciousness.
Repair and Upgrading Cyberware
Cyberware is generally under the skin and thus requires the same technology to repair and upgrade as is required for the original installation process. If CRC was required for augmentation, then it will be required for repair and upgrade. If large quantities of skin are removed, then a Bioweave system (see Bioware) will be required to replace it. If the equipment is available then a successful Bionics Systems skill check is required to repair or upgrade the augmentations. A failure of this could lead to rejection, other systems being damaged or extended rehabilitation times.
Upgrading a suit once fitted is a very rare thing to do because of the prohibitive cost of returning to the Cybershock. Typically all Cyberware augmentations are implanted at the same time to reduce the amount of rehabilitation needed.
Incremental Bionics
The jump from human to a fully suited Aug, in a single operation is often too great of a transition for some. Taking a month off or the great expense can make a fully suited augmentation impractical. Incremental upgrades over time can increase the overall cost.
The systems given here can be applied as upgrades to a premade suit. The Cyber and Borg suit sheets give the breakdown of systems and their effects, so it is easy to replace them if need be.
While upgrading incrementally, there is a point where the Aug may loose their remaining humanity. This occurs at the final stage of augmentation where the last vestiges of the patient are replaced by an armoured shell. The systems installed up until this decision point have been placed under the skin so the Aug will still have a human form. If you want to be bigger and a less-human type of Aug, then go with a suit.
It is recommended to get proper counselling and have a plan for augmentation.  This will help you get the right bionics at the right time and reduce cost and rehabilitation as much as possible.
From Human to Aug
The core of Incremental augmentation is Augmentation Points. Augmentation Points are a representation of how much �space� you have left to install new systems. The starting level of Augmentation points is your Meat Attribute. If your Meat Attribute is then altered by an upgrade, the initial points are not modified.
Some systems use up Augmentation points (they take up space), such as the generators. Other systems provide more Augmentation Points (such as the frame)).
Each system has a number of properties, which act as bonuses to game mechanics or narrative effects. For example, a Motor system gives bonuses to Shift and Meat Attributes, which is a game mechanic. An internal Gaia card allows the user to access Gaia without needing a card, which is a useful narrative effect. If the system does not effect a game mechanic (such as Hit Points), then it will not be listed.
Many systems also have requirements. These requirements must be met before new systems can be installed. For example, you can�t replace muscles with a Motor system without having the Generator system there to power it.
Understanding Bionic Requirements
The chart at the top of the page shows the requirements of all the major types of bionics. Systems on the left hand side  (Rink and Light Armour, Endobioreorg, Organ Engine) do not have any requirements. All the others require the system that it is joined to it on the left.
For example, the Frame requires Generators first.
For each major system, there are many manufacturers at different price ranges. General descriptions are provided below.
Endobioreorg
Requires: Nothing
Install Method: CRC and NBG
The Endobioreorg replaces the digestive system (Digestive, Lymphatic and Urinary). It takes food the Aug has swallowed and extracts nutrients and energy from it. It also gets rid of waste, either through the typical human method or by breaking the solids down to gas. This system is self-powering and self-regulating.
The Endobioreorg is normally the first augmentation that people take as it replaces many of the functions that fail first due to age. In most modern societies across the Imperium, people over the age of 110 have a Endobioreorg and the implant process is seen as routine. The system can rarely be �felt� by the Aug because it works autonomously. The only noticeable benefit is vastly improved digestion in the elderly.
Some lower specification Endobioreorgs enhance the digestive process and are able to break down toxins better to help prevent poisoning.
At higher specifications, the Endobioreorg can extract energy from a wide variety of substances and can be modified by an Aug�s Rink to control bodily functions. Even nutrients can be synthesised from base plant matter that contains no nutrients at all.
Typical Game Effect
Consumes Augmentation Points
Ability to resist poison
Better survival on less food and water.
Rink
Requires: Nothing
Install Method: NBG and CRC
The Rink (Rayengine Link) is a link with a powerful Rayengine. The Rink is a very useful device that can be combined with other technologies to provide the Aug with extra abilities. The Rink is a tiny Ray Engine that is linked to the brain through billions of synapses. Normally, it is used to consciously store information but can also be used to connect with other devices, such as other systems installed in the Aug.
Why you should always get a Rink
Most of the bionics systems do not require that you have a Rink. Having a Rink installed will allow the Aug to control the options on the augmentation. Where the descriptions below offer different ways of working, without a Rink it is left to the system to decide automatically.
For example, the Endobioreorg does not require a Rink. It will process food autonomously. However, a Rink can be used to control whether waste is processed in the same manner as humans or reduced to gas (through belching or flatulence). The Rink gives the Aug that option.
Typical Game Effect
Allows further upgrades and controls other systems.
Organ Engine
Requires: Nothing
Install Method: CRC and NBG
The Organ Engine replaces breathing, circulation and is responsible for keeping the brain alive (Circulatory, Endocrine, Immune, Respiratory). The Organ Engine is a self regulating system that controls blood flow and regeneration, and supplies the body with nutrients from the digestive (or Endobioreorg).
Organ Engines are another common system used to extend the life span by replacing the heart and better providing the brain with nutrients.
Low Specification Organ Engines simply replaces the basic human systems and can provide a tougher immune system.
High Specification Organ Engines have internal oxygen storage to allow the Aug to live without the need to breathe for long periods of time.
Typical Game Effect
Consumes Augmentation points
Allows survival without oxygen
Frame
Requires: Endobioreorg, Organ Engine
Install Method: CRC machine
The frame replaces the Character�s skeleton and its joints.   The structure is normally personalised before installation. The Frame�s primary purpose is to provide a solid structure upon which all the other systems can be mounted. 
The Frame also provides the Aug more protection from damage, allowing more physical punishment before being knocked out. This increases the Character�s Stun score. Frames tend to be heavier than skeletons and without a Motor system the Character will suffer a Shift penalty.
A low specification, the Frame just replaces bones with a large effect on dexterity and little additional protection.
A high specification, the Frame provides more physical protection and additional Augmentation Points for a slight reduction in dexterity.
Typical Game Effect
Provides more Augmentation points
Provide more hit points
Provides more stun
Reduces Shift and Meat Attribute
Generators
Requires: Endobioreorg, Organ Engine, Frame
Install Method: CRC Machine
Generators provide power for other Bionics systems. Installing Generators allows the Aug to further upgrade with additional systems. The Generators need the Endobioreorg and Organ Engine to be installed first because they need space within the torso cavity.
A low specification generator provides little power for a large amount of Augmentation points and vice versa for high specification systems.
Typical Game Effect
Consumes Augmentation points
Provides Power points that are consumed by other systems.
Motor
Requires: Endobioreorg, Organ Engine, Frame, Generators, Rink
Install Method: CRC Machine
The motor system replaces the muscles of the human body with eno-mechanic actuators. This will feel like an enormous change for the Aug because they will feel stronger and faster as a result. Due to the enormous change that occurs, the rehab from the motor system is particularly difficult.
A low specification, Motor systems give the Aug the same statistics as an average human. For those with massive limb damage, this is a cheap and worthy alternative.
A high specification, Motor systems can allow the Aug to leap long distances, run faster and be more dexterous than most humans. 
Typical Game Effect
Improved Meat and Shift
Drop in Soul Attribute
Sensorium
Requires: Rink
Install Method: NBG and CRC
The Sensorium replaces and extends the five senses. Physically, the visual (sight), olfactory (smell), auditory (sound), touch and taste are replaced. Most people find that the improvement in all these makes the world seem sharper. As the senses are extended, then the amount of reality that the Aug can sense is greatly improved. This either has the effect of disturbing the Aug or enlightening them. Rehabilitation is a very necessary part of this system, to allow the Aug to make best use of the sharp and broad senses.
A low specification, the human senses are replaced with a sharper version.
A high specification, the full range of things that modern sensors can sense are installed, giving the Aug an unparalleled view of the world.
Typical Game Effect
Provides better senses for viewing things
Light / Heavy Armour
Light Armour Requires: None 
Heavy Armour Requires: Endobioreorg, Organ Engine, Frame, Generators, Rink, Motor
Install method: CRC
Armour provides additional protection to the systems of the Aug. Armour is split into two types, Light and Heavy. Light armours can be placed under the skin and provide protection to vital organs. A frame and motor are not required.
Heavy armour needs more space inside the body and a strong structure to attach to. Therefore, it needs the Frame and Motor units (and everything else that goes with it).
Low specification armours are heavy, encumber the individual and take up a lot of Augmentation points for very little gain.
High specification armours are light, take up few Augmentation points and provide excellent protection.
Borging
Some Heavy Armours are marked as Borging armours. If these are selected, then the skin of the Aug is removed and armour is replaced. At this point, the Aug is a Borg, not a Cyber and the last vestiges of humanity are removed. This includes genitalia.
Typical Game Effects
Consumes Aug Points
Provides hit points and, armour rating
Reduces Shift and Meat
Other Systems
Requires / Install: Depends on system
There are many more systems that can be installed by the Aug and they have their own properties and requirements. They are not standard augmentation systems and include their own descriptions. These systems range from Grav Packs to medicine injectors. The reason their types are not listed here is that they are not required to make a Bionics suit.
Properties of a System
A system is described by a number of different items, each one describes the effect it has on the game world. Here is a list of all of the items and the effects they have:
Manufacturer
This is the company that produces the item. 
Cost
This is the amount of credits the system costs to buy. Add the cost of each system together for the final suit.
Rarity
This is how rare the system is in percentage (%). See Rarity on page 81 for how it is used.
Type
Either Cyber, Borg or Both. Some systems can only be used as a system under the skin (Cyber), some require the full body replacement (Borg) or some are good for both. A Suit can have a mix of Both and one of the other types.
Install
This is the time in hours the system takes to install. Add this number to the Install times of the other systems.
Rehab
This is the time in hour that the Aug will need after installation to recover from the installation. Add this number to all the other rehabilitation times.
Interval
This is the time that must be waited before another system can be installed. If more than one system is installed in one go, take the largest value.
Machine Install
Denotes which machine is needed to install the system. Either CRC, NBG, Mechbay or a combination. Most bionics shops will have both, so this is less of a problem.
Augmentation Points
This is the space that the system uses in the suit. Some systems give Augmentation points (such as the Frame) where others use them up (Such as Generators). Add the Augmentation points together.
Power Consumption
This is the amount of generator power the system requires. Add the Power Consumptions together.
Attributes (Battle, Meat, Shift, Soul, Wit)
These are your Character Attributes and systems will have an effect on them. To calculate these take your starting Character statistics and then add the suit effects onto them.
Body - Armour Rating
Armour adds protection from the systems. The Armour Rating is dealt with slightly differently to the rest of the body. To work out the Armour Rating, take the highest Armour rating of all the systems.
Body - everything else
Hit points and stun denote how tough the Aug is. Add up the System effect of all the items.
Game Effect
This tells you what game effect the system might have. Things like resistance to disease or a weapon firing modifier. Just list these at the end of your suit.
Installation Instructions
The art of installing bionics is a matter of adding, subtracting and finding the biggest or smallest value. For each system you have, add up the numbers. Once you�ve installed, check that the following rules apply:
1. Augmentation Points and Power Consumption may not be negative.
2. Statistics must be greater than 0.
These rules apply once you�ve installed all of the systems, if they are broken during your installation then that�s not a problem. A character with zero or negative statistics between installations cannot be played until those installations are complete, the GM has full control over the character at this time.
Upgrading Systems
When upgrading a system you already have installed, subtract the hit points and modifiers of the system you are removing and apply the new modifiers of the new system. The rehabilitation time will be the same as it takes considerable effort to readjust.
Bionics Installation Example
This example will show how a Character can be incrementally installed. If you just want to install a ready made suit, then check out the premade suits in the Equipment Index.
John Smith, our example Character from Character creation, has decided that his humanity is available for trade. For this example, some example systems have been invented (and can be found in the Appendix).

Step 1: Endobioreorg
With John, we�re going to incrementally upgrade him, step by step. He starts with 6 Augmentation points (the same as his Meat Attribute). Looking at the requirements diagram, we can begin with Endobioreorg, Organ Engine or Rink. We�ll start with a Test Endobioreorg called a Aero Digestion TEST1.
The Endobioreorg will help keep John alive in difficult circumstances. The only numerical change is to his Torso, which increases by 15 hit points to 55.

Game Effects

Step 2: Organ Engine
The next best step is the Organ Engine, which is another step before getting the Frame installed. We�re going to install the Surebeat Test1 organ engine.
So far, this suit is costing a lot of money and the benefits are minimal. To really get some benefit, you need to install Frame, Generators and Motor too.  He has another slight increase in his Torso hit points to 65.

Game Effects

Step 3: Frame
The frame provides Augmentation points to build other things into. John will be using the most basic frame. At this point, there will be a hit on John�s Attributes. This is because the bone matter has been replaced with a metal version and so he weighs more. This would feel weird and thus effects John�s humanity and mental stability. The benefits in extra hit points are slight but John gets extra Augmentation points to mount generators and motor systems onto. John also has an Armour Rating of 5 now, which won�t protect from even the smallest weapons.

Step 4: Generators
Before we put a new set of muscles (Motor) into John, we need to add the power first. Quite often, the Generators and the Motor systems are added at the same time. As you can see, the Generator is heavy and so reduces John�s Shift considerably.

Step 5: Rink
The Rink is generally a very useful device to have but it is required if you want the Motor system as it provides communication between the brain and the artificial muscles. It does not have any affect on John�s Attributes or hit points but it does allow lots of other systems to be installed. 
People normally have this installed first but it is included here to show it�s not required until this point.

Have a break!
At this point, we could leave the suit as it is and John would have boosted statistics beyond the human norm. However, most Characters would want to go two steps further with a Sensorium (improved senses) and Heavy Armour (better protection).
