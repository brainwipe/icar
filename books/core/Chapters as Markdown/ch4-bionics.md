## Bionics

### Design Principals

- Focussed on new abilities
- Soul spent - when fraction goes over a point then it is removed. You don't get soul back when something is removed
- Heavy on description
- Three types: Borg, Cyber, Bioweave (cheap, normal, expensive)
- Levels: Medical, Industrial, *Retail?/Personal?*, Sports, Expeditionary
- Keep it simple! If you replace a limb and then get armour then add the hit points together
