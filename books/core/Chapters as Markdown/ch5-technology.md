# Technology
Technology can make you stronger, faster and more dangerous. This Chapter introduces technology and equipment behind Icar: what's possible, what's illegal and what you can buy.

For weapons, vehicles and spacecraft, the statistics in this Chapter are an outline. Icar is intended to be played with a full page hand outs that can be found in the Equipment Index.

## New Starters!
Icar has a lot of technology and if you are new to Icar, it can be very daunting. If you are unsure where to begin, look at the equipment that is listed for your Setting. If you are using the Scavenger Setting, the equipment each character gets is listed on the Character Skeleton. You only need to understand those bits of technology, you can skip the rest.

If a player wants to use a bit of technology, then it is up to them to understand how it works and how it might be used. If a gizmo is forgotten about by the player then the opportunity to use it will have passed. It is not the responsibility of the GM to remember who has what and the functions of all the technology in each section.

## Rarity
Rarity is the measure of how difficult it is to get hold of something (in percentage). Rarity can change depending on a character's location. For example, a Hand Cannon is easy to acquire on a planet dedicated to the construction of firearms but next to impossible on planets with gun-restrictive laws. This value can be used in two ways. 

### Rarity as a guide for the GM
Firstly, it can be used as a guide to the GM and players when deciding if a certain item of kit can be obtained. This system should be used with care as decisions should be backed up with a reason.

### Rarity as a Modifier on Street Deal
The second  method is to use the value as a modifier on a Street Deal Skill roll. Use the Rarity as a negative modifier by subtracting the Rarity from the Street Deal Skill before rolling. 

>  For example, if the Character has Street Deal at 50% and they wish to by a Nelson H1 at rarity of 10%, they will need to roll under (50% - 10%) 40%. 

A Character can try every 5 hours to find the goods (roll once for every 5 hours of game time).
If a player does not have Street Deal, then they will need to find another method of obtaining the goods. This is likely to include the use of contacts, Gaia and knowledge. Of course, if they get someone else to find the objects, then they might want to add a fee.

### The Black Market
The Black Market is an illegal method of getting hold of items. Most items (not Imperial Issue ones, like the Qaxam) can be gained on the Black Market at much reduced 'Black' costs. However, the black market on any planet is very difficult to find and often requires local knowledge. 
The Black Market is normally little more than space on the Undergaia that has been set aside for trading less-than-legal goods at low prices. An Isis is essential for the Black Market as it is used a guarantee of ownership. If something has been purchased on the Black Market, then it is impossible for the Star Enforcers to know this. Arrests are normally made by infiltrating the Black Market Undergaia space and following transactions until the goods are handed over. It is also illegal to be found in a Gaia space that is used as a Black Market trading space, although arrests are rare.
Some of the goods are often of poor quality and it is wise to use a knowledgeable person to check it over after purchase. Items on the Black Market also differ in Rarity, so it may either be easier or more difficult to get an object there.
Ownership Dockets
Expensive items (vehicles, spacecraft etc) have a 'Docket' that describes both the owner and the item itself. The Docket is a unique Gaia Entity that proves that the item belongs to someone. Most people keep their Dockets on their Gaiacard but they can also be stored in any Gaia space or on a plastic Datacard. Changing the owner is easy and only requires the owner's agreement. 
The owner can be illegally changed by a successful Hacking check and Forgery check. The skill checks can be performed by different characters but must be done at the same time.
Expeditionary technology
Expeditionaries are mercenaries who tend to work in the unruly areas of Imperial space and outside the Light Jump Net. Expeditionary technology is more expensive, better made and more rare than ordinary technology.
Full page sheets
The Equipment Index is a free PDF that you can download from the web site that include player hand outs of weapons, vehicles and spacecraft. Each sheet represents the in-game Ownership Docket that the Character would own and contains all the rules and statistics that apply to that item.
The sheets should be printed, folded and handed out to the player who's Character owns the Docket. You can also use these sheets as a physical form of who is holding or using an item.
If you are not sure which full page sheets to print, check the GM section of the setting you are playing and it will list the sheets you need.
Legality and Feasibility
Areas of technological discovery are grouped by their legality and feasibility. The Imperium decide (with Star Sci's help) which technologies are illegal. Illegal technologies tend to be those that are dangerous to the general public. Feasibility is whether or not the technology is possible.
Where is Technology X?
Our timeline is different to the one your characters share and as such, some technologies have flourished and others withered. After ninety thousand years, you would expect most discoveries we imagine as obvious today to be present in Icar but are missing. For any given discovery or technological evolution, the reasons for its omission can be complicated and can include one of the following:
Star Sci do most of the research
This is a time of war and corporations perform only that research that is necessary for them to differentiate their products from competitors. Corporations trust in Star Sci to release breakthroughs to industry such that each corporation can benefit. There is no need to squeeze margins by throwing money into blue-sky research when Star Sci are doing it for you.
Star Sci are holding discoveries back
The human race cannot be trusted to act sensibly to the discovery of a new technology. There are countless examples of private individuals accidentally arriving at a discovery, only for it to be their undoing. 
Impractical
Impractical technologies require huge amounts of power, effort or fuel that it is not practical to use them day to day. These technologies tend to become the purview of enthusiasts and hobbyists.
Socially unacceptable
Socially unacceptable technologies are repugnant to Imperial citizens and become forgotten about due to their incompatibly with society's sensibilities.
Superseded
Some modern technology has no use anymore because there is a safer, cheaper alternative.
Possible and Legal
This is a list of legal technologies grouped by how common they are.
Common Technology
Bionics. From small cosmetic enhancements (Cyber) to brain-inside-a-robot (called Borgs). See Bionics on page 72.
Humanoid robots. Called Automatons and barely indistinguishable from humans.
Flying cars. Called 'Grav', just about everything can be made to fly, including restaurant tables and lamps.
Free, clean and safe energy. Called Solid State Generators (or just Generators for short), they are ubiquitous.
Cures for everything. Any disease or human ailment except old age can be cure by hypodermic injection.
Faster than light space travel. Everyone can visit other planets for their holidays. Called Light Jumping, safe and easy.
Virtual world internet. It's called Gaia and so real that humans can be fooled into thinking it is real.
Food replicators. Food can be converted from a material called 'Biomatter' into any organic matter, particularly food. This happens in Bioreorganisers. The food designs are Gaia Entities.
Rare
Energy weapons. Expensive weapon and ammunition. Only owned by those really keen on violence.
Owning your own space craft. Good ones are expensive and bad ones are rarely owned by anyone except player character teams.
Nanotechnology. Is practically limited to operating within a strictly defined space. Used in manufacturing and in some self-repair systems. Turning planets into goo is impractical. Only rare because only technical people really have them.
Beaming. Moving people or objects over large distances is very risky. Star Fleet often beam raw materials to surface and their pilots from their fighters. Civilian uses are confined to beaming ammunition from a holdall to a weapon. Normally only a few hundred kilometres in range.
Possible and Illegal
These technologies have been outlawed by the Imperium.
Ion power. Ion power is a high energy alternative to solid state generators. Can easily be made to explode with huge consequences. Used a lot by the Imperium but illegal to humanity.
Organic weapons. Weapons that can be made in a food Bioreorganiser.
Human Genetic Modification. Made illegal by popular consensus tens of thousands of years ago. Rarely yielded improvements that without huge drawbacks.
Cloning. Seen as distasteful by humanity as all you ever really get is a twin. Personality is not cloned with the human.
Intelligent Robots that can kill. For obvious reasons. See Droid Space on page 28 for details on how it went badly wrong last time.
Impossible, Impractical and Superseded
These technologies are either impossible, impractical or have been superseded by another technology.
Impossible
Transferring human consciousness into a machine. Whatever human consciousness is, it cannot be transferred out of the human. You need a tiny bit of the human left. Copies of the human personality only ends up with a flawed facsimile.
Travel through Black Holes. Every so often someone tries a brave experiment to jump through a black hole. They are never seen again. Not because they have found Nirvana but are dead.
Impractical
Folding space. The difficulty here is measuring what the state of the exit point is before you start the fold. You could be folding yourself onto a temporal spatial distortion. That would hurt.
Nanobots free in the wild. Requires huge amounts of power to feed the Nanobots if they are going to manipulate molecules in an interesting ways.
Superseded
Warp drive. Superseded by the light jump that was safer and allowed speeds 100 times quicker.
Sensors
Sensors in Icar allow the users to see further and in much greater detail. It is up to the player to ask the Gamesmaster to explain what additional information a given sensor provides during a scene. The Gamesmaster's call is final. 
Sensors are one of two types: Device Sensors and Scanners. Device Sensors are fitted to weapons, devices and bionic upgrades. Scanners tend to be built into buildings and medical facilities. Device Sensors provide the user with the raw information, whereas Scanners provide some interpretation.
For example, a Level 2 Tech Scanner can be fitted to the door of a members-only bar. When you walk through it, it will know what sort of a gun you're carrying and whether it is loaded. An Electrogrid (EG) sensor will show that you're carrying a generator - it could be a gun or part of your tech kit - it is up to the owner of the EG sensor to decide!
Device Sensors
These sensors are normally built into a device, weapon or bionic upgrade. They provide some interpretation for the user and come with a variety of features.
Electromagnetic (EM)
EM sensors cover the electromagnetic spectrum, expanding what humans can ordinarily see into Ultraviolet and Infrared. Under ultraviolet, organic matter shows up more easily and in Infrared you can see heat. EM also includes teleoptics, allowing you to magnify objects either close up (like a microscope) or at a distance (like a telescope). 
With EM sensors, the further you are from something, the less powerful they are. Standing near a wall will allow you to see hot objects on the other side but if you are standing a mile from a bunker, you will not be able to see hot objects inside it.
Motion (MT)
Motion tracker sensors are sensitive to the energy of movement. Motion trackers can pick up the movement of small rodents through to spacecraft. As a rule of thumb, the more energy is required to move something, the brighter it appears on motion. Motion trackers have a range, after which they do not detect motion at all.
Energy Grid (EG)
EG sensors detect raw energy patterns. This means any object that is using power can be seen. The more power something is using, the brighter it is. At distance, the sensor is less affective. EG is not affected at all by occlusion unless there is a brighter energy source in the way. You can just see a Grav car at 1 mile away, you can see the generator in a gun through a wall and you can see where power cables run easily enough.
Extended Audio (EA)
Extended audio covers the usual hearing range, including amplification and noise reduction by measuring infinitesimal changes in air pressure over a broad area. Pressure waves caused by explosions can be recorded and analysed too.
Environment (EN)
The environment sensor is used to measure the environment from a distance. Atmosphere, organic matter and life signs can be detected. Effective range of the sensor depends entirely on its size and therefore what it is mounted on. Powered armour EN sensors extend as far as a few miles, whereas spacecraft EN sensors work from high orbit to the surface of a planet.
Scanners
Scanners are tend to be large devices installed into a building as part of their security infrastructure. They come in two types - Tech Scanners and Medical Scanners. The more detailed information you need from your scanner, the more time you have to wait.
For scanners use in society see Scanning and Privacy on page 41.
Tech Scanners (TS)
Most commonly found in spacecraft air locks and the entrances to bars, they are mostly used for scanning for weapons. These are not just metal detectors, they scan using a broad range of sensors and are very difficult to fool. Tech scanners are either hand-held or mounted in buildings. Tech scanners cannot detect Bioweave augmentation.
Level 1. Can be hand-held. Needs to be held close to the thing you are scanning. Takes one round (3 seconds). Can detect weapons, Gaiacards and whether or not the person is Borged or Cybered.
Level 2. Very expensive if hand-held. Usually mounted into doors. Can detect up to 5 metres. Takes 2  rounds (6 seconds). Can detect type of weapons or bionics to determine capabilities. Can also detect manufacturer's signature.
Level 3. Only found in dedicated engineering bays, sensor data gathered from a cloud of floating sensors that take up position around the object. Takes up to 1 minute (20 rounds). Can detect faults.
Medical Scanner (MS)
The purview of the Medic, the medical scanner is commonly used to diagnose the sick.
Level 1. Can be hand-held. Must be close to the subject. Can detect vital statistics, bone breaks, blood toxins, major diseases, disabilities through genetic abnormality. Takes one round (3 seconds). Cannot detect Bioweave.
Level 2. Normally mounted in Medical facility beds. Can detect genetic level scan, genome recognition and gene finger prints. User needs to be lying on the bed to use. Also can scan bionics like a Tech scanner would scan level 3. Takes 2 rounds (6 seconds). Can detect Bioweave.
Level 3. Same capabilities as the Level 1 and 2 scanners but can be found mounted in doorways and can detect up to 10 metres. Rare to find. Takes 3 rounds (9 seconds).
Gaia Entities
Gaia Entities are intelligent programs that live inside Gaia. Then tend to be kept on a Gaiacard and can be started whenever the Gaiacard is inside a terminal - either a terminal you plug it into (tanked Gaia) or an immersive terminal you walk into.
Style, shape and size
Entities come in all sorts of shapes and sizes. The cheapest ones tend to be simple geometric shapes. More complex entities come in the form of real world replicas, such as pets or people. Human looking entities are very popular as they are easier for people to relate to. 
Most hackers will have all sorts of shapes for entities, sometimes matching to form a set of similar tools (such as birds of prey). The entities given below come in a range of shapes and sizes. An entity that might look cool should cost a little more.
Permissions
You can start a Gaia Entity wherever you are in Gaia, regardless of security level. However, a Gaia Entity may not enter a higher security level unless given entry. For more information on security, see Hacking on page 19.
One shot Entities
Most Entities can be used as many times as you like. However, others are destroyed in the very act of using them. One shot entities are always unique.
Writing Your Own Entities
To make your own, you need the Skill Gaia Design. If you want to create something with Artificial Intelligence self-sufficiency then you need the Skill Artificial Intelligence. The designer will need a Gaiacard, although a Public terminal will be enough to create the entity. The only cost is time. The best rule of thumb is 1 hour per 100 credits. For an AI system, it takes 2 hours per 100. 
For example, to recreate the Shell Ent. Infotracker 20, which costs 200 and is an AI; will take 4 hours to make a similar system. If the player fails either Gaia Design or Artificial Intelligence, then the time is wasted and they must start again. In most cases, the player is better off buying the Entity.
Public Entities
Owned by a lot of people and used everywhere, these Entities are created by legal companies and can be bought quickly across Gaia. These Entities have a very low rarity. The big three Gaia Entity companies are Gaianware, Ellipsian Entities (or simply E2) and Shell Entertainment (Shell Ent.).
Infotracker
Public search AI
Type: AI
A search AI has the Research Skill at a low % but has the ability to keep searching for something. The better the research Skill of the AI, the more expensive it is. The AI will only search for one thing at a time and the user must describe in detail what it is they want. They can be used to find out information, objects or people on Gaia. By their very nature, they are free wheeling Entities and return periodically to the Gaiacard to report findings. 
If the Gaiacard is not plugged in, it cannot return any information. If the Gaiacard is not plugged in for some time and the owner moves through real space (not Gaia), then when it is plugged in, it will take time for the Entity to find the Gaiacard. The further you move without the Gaiacard plugged in, the more difficult it is for the Entity to find the user.
Infotracker 20, Research 20%, Cost: 200, Rarity: 10%
Infotracker 30, Research 30%, Cost: 400, Rarity: 13%
Infotracker 40, Research 40%, Cost: 1000, Rarity: 14%
Gaianware Infotracker 50, Research: 50%, Cost: 1500, Rarity: 15%
Gaia Personal Assistant
Type: AI
This Artificially Intelligent Entity will remain in one location and take/give messages for you. To allow anyone to leave a message, the Entity must be placed in a Public Space. The Entity may be sent with a message for a specific person with instructions on how to give the message. 
Although Unique through its AI, the appearance of the Entity can either be the rather boring 'Neohuman', a very generic looking human Entity or a unique and attractive form. Attractive Personal Assistants cost more. The more you pay, the more attractive they will be. The Personal Assistant will not follow the user around Gaia, it needs to be placed manually by the user. Most people place a Personal Entity in the Public Space of their apartment.
Shell Ent. Personal Assistant. Neohuman. Cost: 200. Rarity: 2%
Shell Ent. Personal Assistant. Mythological Creatures. Cost: 500. Rarity: 5%
Shell Ent. Personal Assistant. Famous People.
Gaianware. Personal Assistant. Male/Female. Cost: 400 - 5000. Rarity: 3%-10%
E2. Personal Assistant. Executive Package. Cost: 6000 - 8000. Rarity: 11%
Training Entities
A training Entity is an immersive Gaia simulation that people use to learn new skills. Training Entities will not be able to train as well as another human or experience but they can be used to start someone off in a Skill. Every Training Entity comes with a cap of the highest Skill percentage they can train someone to. The more expensive the training Entity, the higher the skill that can be attained. 
A Training Entity can only train in a single skill and are unique Entities. More than one person can train through the Entity.
For the rules using the Entities, see Improving Skills on page 6.
Training Entity up to 25%, 9000.
Training Entity up to 35%, 15 000.
Training Entity up to 55%, 20 000.
Hacking Entities
Hacking Entities are Artificially Intelligent and illegal tools to assist a Hacker in breaking into Gaia volumes and moving around in them. Some provide more information to allow a Hacker a better chance of finding their task, others aid in dealing with Entities inside the system. Hacking Entities can be sought out in the Undergaia or created by the character. Finding a dealer in the Undergaia is more than a simple skill check - you must be introduced, perform a favour and demonstrate you are not a Star Enforcer before you get anywhere near the actual Entities. 
Most Hackers write their own (see Writing Your Own Entities) and must pass Hacking and Artificial Intelligence skill checks.
A Hacker can carry many Hacking Entities on their Gaiacard but if they are discovered by a Star Enforcer then they may be arrested as a dealer, rather than simply a Hacker. Owning Hacking Entities are illegal but Star Enforcers need hard evidence that an Entity has been used to perform an illegal act. However if your character is carrying many of them on their Gaia card, then that is all the evidence needed to be arrested as a dealer.
Back Door 
Type: Hacking AI
Allows access back into a system once the character been there. Best used when deep inside a system to gain entry with one roll rather than having to hack all the way in.
Cost: 5000
Modifier to use: -20%
Refail
Type: Hacking AI
Covers up the character's error and allows another try. When you fail a dice roll, use Refail to re-roll it. You can only use one Refail in a Hacking session.
Cost: 6000
Modifier to use: -20%
Trail
Type: Hacking AI
Follows another user or Entity on Gaia. Normally used to follow non-Gaia savvy targets as it is not particularly subtle. If the Character is being trailed by a Trail Hacking entity, the Character must make a Hacking check to detect and another to destroy it.
Most members of the public can be tracked with Trail.
Cost: 3500
Modifier to use: -10%
Stealth Trail
Type: Hacking AI
Follows another user or any item on Gaia and reports back every minute on their location. Successful Hacking check at Tricky (-30%) difficulty required to detect and unmodified Hacking check to destroy.
Stealth Trail is intended for tracking Gaia-savvy targets. For members of the general public, use the much cheaper Trail.
Cost: 5000
Modifier to use: -20%
Chameleon
Type: Hacking AI
Make any object in Gaia (doors, cars, trucks) look like something else. Requires Gaia Know roll at Hard to detect the Chameleon and see the real object underneath it. Once the Chameleon is used to take on a form, it can only be used for that form. For example, if the Chameleon is used to hide a car as a Hauler then the Chameleon will only ever be able to represent a Hauler.
Cost: 3000
Modifier to use: -20%
Looper
Type: Hacking AI
Loops all the real world sensors (camera, heat, movement etc) within 50m. Anyone moving around in that area will not be picked up by security. Includes weapon and medical scans. This can be dangerous if used near medical facilities and as such Loopers are searched for in those areas with particular gusto.
Cost: 2000
Modifier to use: -10%
Generator Overloader
Type: Hacking AI
Solid state generators do not explode easily but a special AI Hacking Entity can be created to push them to the point of explosion. The Generator Overloader is easy to remove but must be done when physically at the generator. The larger the generator, the longer it takes to overload. Small generators (lights, cameras) take 20 seconds up to large (spacecraft, buildings), which take up to 10 minutes. Generators powering bionics cannot be overloaded with this Entity because there is a user constantly at the physical location of the generator!
Cost: 4000
Modifier to use: -30%
Soft Light Projectors
Soft Light is holographic technology, created using a Soft Light projector. Unlike Hard Light, soft light cannot produce a force. It is just light. It shines, can be made into animations and may appear to be very real but it cannot affect the rest of the world except shining light onto it. Soft Light can render Gaia Entities in the real world but those entities will only be visual representations, they cannot directly affect anything.
Soft Light objects are normally used by artists. Soft Light Entities can be animated in the real world and can be as large, complex and beautiful as you need.
If a Soft Light projection is made to look real, the only way to detect that it is a hologram (without touching it) is using augmented sensors, such as EM or EG. 
Soft Light in advertising
The most common use of holographic soft light is advertising from brightly coloured displays showcasing a latest product to a soft light human that walks alongside you and acts as a salesperson. In some colonies, having a Soft Light salesperson is seen as an insult, whereas elsewhere it is seen as a useful tool.
Soft Light in art and entertainment
Soft light is a malleable form of expression that is used alongside music. Huge Soft Light projections are used by artists to entertain and delight. Celebrations are often accompanied by beautiful displays of Soft Light. In 'In Fizz' nightclubs, a Soft Light artists will be employed alongside a DJ to create art on the fly to improve the experience of the revellers.
Costs
Soft Light projectors are relatively inexpensive. Their size relates to how large a volume they can project into. As a guide to the sizes:
Shop floor area or whole apartment: 100
Entire floor of a mex building: 5000
1km x 1km x 1km volume: 10 000
The artistry involved in the projection acts as a multiple. Stock celebratory images (such as Happy Birthday) will cost the same as the prices listed above. A jobbing designer will have a multiplier of 1.5 times and famous artists up to 5 times.
Hard Light Projectors
Hard Light projectors allow you to animate Entities in the real world. In a holoroom Gaia terminal, any Hard Light Entity can be animated without any fuss. When outside a Holoroom, creating a Hard Light shape is more difficult. Unfortunately, the more complex an Entity, the more expensive the projector needs to be. The projector acts as its own self contained unit and Hard Light objects can be loaded onto it.
To use a Hard Light projector, use a Gaia terminal to move a hard light object onto the projector. From this point on, you can animate the object by squeezing the middle of the projector and throwing it. As soon as the projector is clear of your hand, it will animate the Hard Light object you've set it to. There are a couple of exceptions to this (Hard Light swords) but most projectors follow this method.
To de-animate, the object will have a way of deanimating it (such as a simple switch or pad to press). The object with instantly deanimate. Anything resting (or sitting) on the object will fall to the ground.
Limitations
A Hard Light projection has a zero armour rating (AR) and hit points (HP). You can't use a Hard Light image as armour. If it takes any damage, it will de-animate.
Only complex Hard Light items can have a Blast Factor, otherwise none. You cannot make bullets or lasers out of Hard Light.
The object will not animate if there is an obstruction. You can't animate a 2m square box inside a 1m square box.
Hard Light projectors can only sense when the objects is being touched. It cannot sense anything else unless it is part of a more complex system.
Complexity
The more complex the object, the more expensive the projector. For simplicity, projectors are produced with three complexity types: Low, Medium and High. A description of each is given below.
Low
No moving parts. No sharp edges. No complex materials. Low detail.
Inflatable chair, Walking stick.
Medium
Some small moving parts. Some detail. No sharp edges.
Recliner chair, Umbrella, Parachute.
High
Nearly all of the High Complexity projectors are a special case as they nearly always make part of another system. They are often expensive, rare and easily replaced with a real-world version that does the job just as well.
Some small moving parts. High level of detail. Sharp edges.
Sword (special case), Automaton.
Automatons
Buying an Automaton is not like buying a car. It's more like buying a pet. Not only are there physical attributes to account for but there is also a personality to decide upon. It is personality that is most important to most people. Every Automaton is different. Buying an Automaton follows these steps:
Choose either new or second hand
Choose a Model
Decide on a name
Select a Personality Template
Add Skills
New or Second Hand
Brand new Automatons begin with plain personalities, whereas second hand, older Automatons can have quite extreme personalities formed by their experiences. Due to their quirky nature (and better Skills), older Automatons are more expensive than new ones. Older Automatons also appear to have more 'common sense', because they are used to operating in a human world. New Automatons are treated like children that have a gift for a few defined subjects but are terrible in general social situations.
The Appendix of this book shows new Automatons only. To make up a second hand one, use the given new ones, reduce the hit points to indicate damage, set the personality as an extreme version of one of the templates and add some Skills. To calculate cost, make up the Automaton as if it is new and then multiply using the following table. For really old Automatons (100 years or more), then their value can be just about anything. The Auto can be too eccentric to be useful to anyone or be very knowledgeable and thus priceless.
The affect of an Automaton's age on its value
Age (years)	Value Multiplier
1-5	x 1
6-20	x 2
21-50	x 3
51-100	x 4
101+	See paragraph

Choose a Model
Automatons come in two forms, Humanoid and Industrial.
Humanoid Automatons are designed to integrate with society. They are based on the human form. The more expensive ones have realistic synthetic skin and are difficult to tell apart from humans without using some sort of sensors. All Humanoid Automatons come with a basic personality and a basic human empathy such that they can hold conversations and understand tone and meaning.
Industrial Automatons are more like complex robots of old. Normally large, strong and designed to perform a particular range of tasks. They simply obey human instructions and are trained such that they have an affinity with technical subjects. They understand any tools that are fitted to them and are normally trained to be able to work on a particular group of tasks.
Decide on a name
A name might be a frivolous idea to the players and Characters but to the Automaton, it's very important. It is the first connection that the Automaton has to the human world.
Applicable to new Automatons only.
Select a Personality Template
An Automaton's personality is represented by a cut-down Deviant Wheel, similar to the one on the normal Character sheet. A Personality Template is an initial Deviant Wheel that you pick from the list given below. Over time, the Automaton's personality will grow from this first step.
An automaton is judged by a cut down Deviant wheel: Serious, Calm, Introvert, Machine, Virtuous. And their opposites are on the other side of the wheel. The different facets are described below:
Serious
A serious Automaton is one that has not yet developed a sense of humour. A sense of humour is normally associated with Automatons that have experienced a lot. Therefore, brand new Automatons are unlikely to have a well developed sense of humour.
Calm
Most Automatons appear to be calm when they are new but they soon become excitable. If your Automaton will be under fire, this facet should be high. If your Automaton will be looking after children, then a low value is preferred.
Introvert
An introverted Automaton is a quiet one and keeps itself to itself. It will not go out of its way to make friends and be helpful to humans. However, if talked to then an introverted Automaton will politely hold conversation.
Machine
This is a measure of how machine-like the Automaton's personality is. It is intrinsically linked to the other personality facet. Initial personality templates are always set to 4.
Virtuous
This is a measure of how naive the Automaton is. Will it automatically believe anything that's told to it or is it a more questioning Automaton. Initial personality templates are always set to 4.
Personality Templates
Amicable
The Amicable personality template is a good starting point for any Automaton buyer. It is the default template for the buyer who is not sure what task the Automaton will perform. An Amicable Automaton is calm, respectful, serious and will look for opportunities to be helpful. It is how you might expect an Automaton to be.
Clown
The clown is a lively, fun and outgoing. They make excellent companions rather than business Automatons. The Clown personality template is most often found with Automatons who are involved in child care. Their light hearted view on the world make them popular with children.
Austere
The Austere Automaton is ideal for business. Serious, calm, capable and an air of servitude. This Automaton personality will not embarrass you or your company.
Add Skills
To make your Automaton really useful to the team as a whole, ensure that it has Skills that fill gaps in the team's abilities. Automaton Skills come with a Skill percentage, cost a certain amount of money and take time for the Automaton to learn. The more complex the Skill, the more expensive it is and the longer it takes to learn.

Weapons
An Icar campaign is an arms race. As your character grows, so too will their armament. As your character wields more powerful weapons, so will the enemies it faces. A weapon speaks volumes about your character. A Nelson pistol represents the innocence of the civilian; the Igniter: a precision killer and the Korg is brutality incarnate.
This section describes the technologies used in weapons. A description of what all the statistics mean can be found in Firefighting on page 10. This is not meant to be a definitive list of all the weapons; more detail and weapons can be found in the Equipment Index, which can be downloaded from the web site.
Close Combat Technology
Close Combat weapons are used by people who cannot afford ammunition or wish to go unnoticed. Very few Firearms can be concealed like a knife or short sword. Blades can be made very sharp, able to pierce armours that projectile firearms (such as a rifle or pistol) cannot. Close Combat technology is based around concealment and sharpness.
Close combat weapons do damage depending on the strength of the user. What makes them different is their sharpness (Blast Factor/BF). Damage and Stun for different weapons can be found in Hand Weapons on page 13.
Polyceramic Alloy
Easy to manufacture and make very sharp indeed, Polyceramic alloy is the favourite material for thugs and the street.
Blast Factor: 15
Natural Polyceramic Unibody
A weapon made from a single organic-like material that contains veins and fissures like human bone and tissue. Weapons made with this technology are not detectable on Level 2 Tech Scans or below.
Blast Factor: 32
Hard Light
Hard Light blades use Hard Light projectors (see Hard Light Projectors on page 86) to create a blade of photon-width sharpness. When deanimated, the Hard Light blade is a handle with a solid state generator. As such, they are difficult to conceal and are visible on even the simplest of scans. Their Blast Factor is 100, which cuts all armours and shields too. Hard Light weapons are rare and often seen as an expensive fashion accessory. Most bionic Akarakian warriors carry a Hard Light sword.
Blast Factor: 100
Firearm Technology
Firearms are grouped into Projectile and Energy weapons. Projectile weapons fire solid slugs of hardened metal, whereas Energy weapons fire raw energy.
Firearm Ammunition Comparison
Description	Rarity	Cost	BF
Projectile 2.2 - Pistols, SMG	5%	1	10 to 20
Projectile 5.5 - Assault Rifle	10%	5	25 to 50
Projectile 7.4 - Machine gun	20%	50	55 to 75
Projectile 10.2 - Shells	75%	100	70 to 80
Energy 5 or 10 Gauge - Pulse	40%	30	100
Energy 15 Gauge - Pulse Laser	50%	80	100
Energy 20 Gauge - Pulse Laser (space craft)	20%	200	100

Projectile and Chain
Projectile weapons fire sharpened lumps of ceramic alloy. They fire using the polarity of energy-doped materials, not a chemical propellant and are therefore more like rail guns than 20th Century firearms. The whole round is accelerated down the barrel, there are no cases or muzzle flash. Most projectile weapons still make a bang sound as the sudden acceleration of the round breaks the sound barrier.
Projectile ammunition comes in 3 sizes marked with a P: 2.2P, 5.5P and 7.4P. They are analogous to 9mm, 7.62mm and a canon shell respectively. 7.4 is dealt with differently because of its size and the momentum it carries. Weapons that fire 7.4 is referred to as Chain guns as the ammunition is normally found in belts called chains. 
Pulse and Pulse Laser
Pulse and Pulse Laser weapons both use energy rounds about the size of a traditional  20th Century Staedtler eraser. Each round is a solidified block of raw energy. Until fired, the rounds are inert, throwing a grenade into a bag of them will not make them explode. All energy weapons have a Blast Factor of 100. Energy ammunition comes in gauges, which measures their potency rather than their size: 5G (pulse pistols), 10G (pulse rifles), 15G (pulse laser) and 20G (spacecraft mounted pulse laser).
When a pulse round is converted into energy, it can take many forms. For example, it can be purely kinetic energy that will knock the target over when fired. Without the weapon specifying a type of energy, the pulse will pass through whatever it can until it runs out of damage. Pulse holes tend to be burnt or melted at the edge. Pulse rounds are only in 5G and 10G sizes.
Pulse Laser rounds are much like default pulse rounds but are bound with light so the type of energy it turns into on contact remains the same. They tend to do more damage, have higher rates of fire and are more common. They are the de facto standard weapon for spacecraft mounted weapons. Pulse laser rounds are only in 15G and 20G sizes.
Grav Balancing
Grav balancing is an anti-gravity system that reduces the mass of the weapon, making it lighter. Grav balancing also reduces the kick of a weapon when fired, helping the user to keep the weapon pointed at its intended target. All weapons are fitted with a Grav balancing system. The weight of the weapon is due to the generator required to accelerate the rounds.
Grenades
Much like in the 20th Century, grenades are mini explosive devices. They can be thrown or fired from a weapon and can have a number of different detonation options that are decided before the grenade is fired. 
Grenades come in two sizes: Low Velocity Grenades (LVG) and High Velocity Grenades (HVG). LVGs are the size of a 'D' Cell battery and have a typical blast radius of 25m. These can be thrown. LVGs come in a vast array of applications, both destructive and pacifying. HVGs are much more powerful, the size of a 20th Century can of Coca Cola and have a typical blast radius of 50m. They are always destructive and usually fired (you have to be augmented to throw it far enough for you to not be in its blast radius).
Grenades to damage to everything in their radius. For a human, that would mean applying the damage to head, left arm, right arm, torso, left leg and right leg separately. For a fragmentation LVG, that would be 100 points to each location, or 600 points in total. For larger objects than people, take an estimate of how much damage it takes. The larger it is, the more it takes.
Triggers (Optional)
Grenades normally explode when they hit something. However, all grenades come with a variety of triggers that allow the user to specify the conditions under which they explode. These can be quite complicated and are up to the player to describe, they include:
On a timer.
When something passes nearby
When hot or cold
When hit really hard indeed
When tampered with
Low Velocity Grenades (LVG)
LVGs are the size of a 'D' Cell battery and have a typical blast radius of 25m. They can be thrown but are normally fired from a weapon.
LVGs come in a variety of different types such as stun, smoke, fragmentation and napalm. The statistics for each are show below.
Low Velocity Grenades (LVG)
Description	Rarity	Cost	BF	Damage	Stun
Stun	20%	100	0	0	200
Fragmentation	20%	200	30	100	100
Napalm	30%	250	35	50/turn	50
Impact Foam	35%	300	0	N/A	N/A
Gravity Shock	50%	1000	0	N/A	N/A
Anti-Motion Tracker smoke	30%	600	0	N/A	N/A
Temporary Energy Sink (TES)	75%	2000	100	N/A	N/A
Energy Disruption (ED)	90%	10 000	100	N/A	N/A

Impact Foam
An Impact Foam grenade is filled with compressed foam. Upon impact, the grenade fills a volume of 10m x 10m x 10m with a fast-solidifying protective foam. Anything inside the foam is then protected from impact as the foam acts as a energy soak. Impact Foam grenades can be triggered inside Grav Cars just before impact or used inside space crates. The foam dissolves to nothing after an hour. The foam is oxygen and water rich, so anyone encased in it can survive without harm. The foam is not armoured and will only protect the inhabitants from damage and stun caused by an impact.
Gravity Shock
A Gravity Shock grenade temporarily applies a different frame of gravity to the affected area. At the centre of the explosion, everything is subjected to 10g of force. The effect wears off toward the edge. The affect is instantaneous and lasts for only 3 seconds (the length of a combat turn). No damage or stun is done directly but those inside the shock area may well 
Temporary Energy Sink (TES)
A Temporary Energy Sink explosion depletes energy within its radius for a number of turns (specified on the grenade). Bionics will find it difficult to move, weapons will become useless and Grav cars will lose their ability to fly. Although they work for a few seconds, their affect can be devastating.
TES grenades are illegal but can be sourced on the black market as their technology is comparatively simple.
Energy Disruption (ED)
Energy Disruption grenades deplete the raw energy from a generator on a small scale. This has the devastating effect of halting bionics, bring down Grav Cars, shutting down weapons, shutting off lights, dropping shields and jamming doors within its radius. They ignore armour and shields.
They are only used by the Imperium in extreme circumstances and are otherwise an illegal technology. ED grenades do not work on any generator than that carried in a Hauler or Orbihaul - nor can they be chained together to destroy the generators of spacecraft.
High Velocity Grenades (HVG)
HVGs are powerful explosives that can be fired over long distances. HVGs are cheaper alternatives to missiles and are the size of the 20th Century can of Coca Cola. The weapons required to fire HVGs tend to be more expensive and the weight of the grenades themselves is quite high. A mercenary that carries HVGs is likely to earn prestige amongst other mercenaries.
High Velocity Grenades (HVG)
Description	Rarity	Cost	BF	Damage	Stun
Fragmentation	30%	500	60	400	200
Napalm	40%	600	65	200/turn	100

Missiles
Missiles are guided explosives that rely upon a mix of Grav lift and chemical propellant. Missiles are not favoured by most combatants as they are often unreliable and intelligent defence can be used to redirect or avoid the blast.
Missiles come in two sizes: micromissile and SWIRL. Micromissile  and SWIRLs are treated exactly the same as LVGs and HVG grenades.
The user does not need to have line of sight when shooting missiles and they take a turn to hit their target.
Unpowered Armour
Armour is extremely important. Weapons in Icar can shred you in a second. Unpowered armour and environment suits come in a variety of types (listed below) and styles.
Styles of Armour
For each type of armour (for example Moss Sports Impact Armour), many styles and colours can be ordered. All of these armours can be purchased as an Oversuit - a baggy over-clothing boiler suit or as a Second Skin (goes under clothes like a very thin wet suit) at no extra cost. Second skin armours do not protect your clothing or personal affects (such as Gaiacard) so be careful where you go.  Oversuits are conspicuous and can be worn as a fashion statement. Helmets for all of these armours collapse into the collar when not required and do not restrict view when in use. 
Extra-Vehicular (EV) Armour
Some armours will protect you in hazardous environments such as space or on planets where the temperature is very high or low with toxic atmospheres. EV-suits are special armours made just for that purpose, whereas Powered Armour tends to have EV properties by default. Basic EV suits are Oversuits, rather than second skin. This is because clothing may not survive the rigours of the environment you have chosen to go out into. For example, a leather jacket may be fine in space but in a 250 degree maelstrom with acid-rich atmosphere, it won't last long.

For those travelling to more dangerous parts of the cosmos, Moss's Expeditionary Armour is the toughest unpowered armour they offer. Incorporating Moss's typical EV specifications (it will protect against vacuum; fire; extreme cold (-200C) and heat (+300C); radiation; pressure (20 ATM)).
Personal Shield Generators
Personal Shield generators are a popular way to provide a compact protection against damage. For rules on shields see Shields on page 9. Shields form an invisible layer around the user's form - including their clothing and anything they are carrying (within reason, a personal shield will not cover an entire Grav Car but will cover the driver). They only work from the outside in, allowing you to fire out through them. All shields have an AR of 100.
Anything with a small mass hitting the shield with great energy will have its energy sapped from it. This includes bullets, shrapnel and meteorites. Heavier objects moving quickly will transfer its energy onto the user of the shield without stun and damage. This might disable the shield (GM decides). 
For example, if you are hit by a speeding car, you will be thrown back and the shield will shut down. You will not take damage (you might take Stun at the GM's discretion). If you fall from a great height (more than 20m), a normal shield will not be able to slow you down gently enough and you will take Stun and some damage.
Moss Suresafe Shield
Cost: 1800
Hit Point Soak: 300 (per turn)
Rarity: 70%
Whether you are scavenging in debris or taking fire from void pirates then the Suresafe shield is for you. Capable of soaking up enough damage to keep you safe in most hazard areas.

Rarity:80%
Treasure hunts that cross the Light Jump Net need that extra amount of safety and security. Moss has taken extra care to ensure that their expeditionary shield is suitable in even the harshest of environments.
Aubury Personal Shield
Cost: 20 000
Hit Points Soak: 800 (per turn)
Rarity: 85%
The Aubury personal shield comes in a discrete wallet that can be carried in an inside pocket. When switched on, it can protect the discerning executive from a barrage.
Powered Armour
Powered armour (PA) is armour whose joints are supported by energy powered motors that give the wearer extra strength, speed and the ability to carry more - armour, sensors, weapons and supporting technology. 
Most Powered Armours are Oversuits and tend to be bulky and powerful. There are some Second Skin style Powered Armour suits but they tend to be extremely expensive. Most Powered Armour suits allow you to carry more, shown as a positive encumbrance.
Generic Powered Armour Systems
All powered armours have the following systems.
Life Support
Life support includes breathing apparatus and waste recycling (back into water and food). Life support will refresh automatically when it is in an environment other than vacuum.
The length of time that a user can survive in the suit is known as Extra Vehicular EV (outside the space craft) and is measured in hours. This time is given as a guide, assuming that the user  is in a vacuum and working quite hard. If the user passes into a nebula, other space craft or even hazardous planet surface then the suit will make use of whatever resources it can to refresh its systems and even allow the user to survive indefinitely.
All powered armours protect against vacuum; fire; extreme cold (-200C); and heat (+300C); radiation; pressure (20 ATM).
Emergency ejection
If the powered armour suffers a critical failure, it can mechanically eject the pilot. The suit is clever enough to understand whether doing this is best for the user.
Grav Pack
A Grav Pack allows the suit to fly and manoeuvre in space. Grav Packs are not intended for use in combat and are slow and unresponsive. If performing any kind of vehicle combat using a stock Grav Pack then use your Powered Armour Use skill like you would Pilot Grav. Unless otherwise specified, the Grav Pack statistics are:

Engineering
Engineering technology covers the tools of the trade of engineer. There are two ways to approach engineering technology: Tech Kits or Advanced. For most players, a Tech Kit is enough detail. Owning a Tech Kit will enable the character to do technical things and will give a bonus to Skill checks.
Advanced items are for when both the GM and the player are comfortable with technology and want a little more detail. Most technical characters will want to start with a Tech Kit and then add the Advanced items as the gaming group gets more comfortable with the setting.
Tech Kits
Each Tech Kit provides the character with the ability to solve the vast majority of technical tasks. The precise content of the Tech Kit is not listed - assume it contains the far future variants of everything you would find in a well stocked toolbox today.
Any Tech Kit can be used by any branch of the Technology Skill tree. If the character specialises in Colony Technologies or Vehicle Technology, the core tech items are the same. The only exception is that Gaia technology Skills do not get bonuses with Tech Kits.
Contents of a Typical Tech Kit
A Tech Kit will contain the following:
Weld Tape
A strong, sticky tape that can be used to bind any two things together. Can only be split using an energy cutter. Weld Tape is future Duct Tape (gaffer tape).
Atomic Slip
A spray-on lubricant fluid that helps move two surfaces that are stuck together with friction. The spray fluid is atom-wide and can slide between two surfaces that appear to be touching, even to the naked eye.
Energy Cutter
A cross between a circular saw and a chainsaw, the energy cutter will cut through anything. The larger the hole you want, the longer it will take. A human sized doorway through a wall of armour rating 15 will take approximately 30 seconds. A hole enough to reach an arm through will take 3 seconds.
Allosealer
The allosealer can join any two inorganic items together. Welding shut a typical door takes approximately 15 seconds, air locks 30 seconds.
Flux Cable
Flux cables are power cables that can be used to feed power between two places. Tech Kit flux cable tends to be light and long (20 metres). A typical flux cable will just hold the weight of a typical human and is as bulk as a 20th Century USB cable.
Screamer
Screamers attach to the power grid (called energy web) of any object and allow Hackers to gain access to it. This is important for spacecraft hacking because spacecraft cannot be hacked from physically outside without a screamer being in place. Typically, engineers will secrete screamers on a spacecraft before it departs and then the Hackers can gain access when required.
Small Generator
Solid state generators power everything in the Icar universe and having a solid state generator can power a car, keep an augmented human alive, provide power to a dead airlock, provide a needed boost in a tight spot and more.
Torque Gun
If you need something opening, such as an air lock then a torque gun will provide the force you need.
Third Hand
The third hand is a hovering claw about the same size as a human hand that is used for holding things still while the engineer works. It obeys voice commands of its owner and has the same strength as another strong human.
Shakespeare Universal Tech Kit
The Shakespeare Universal Tech Kit (known to technologists as simple The Universal) is the entry level Tech Kit used by engineers across the Galaxy. It contains everything needed to fix the very large and the very small. 
The Universal is a reliable set of folding tools in a soft memory fabric that grips the tools, which cannot slip out.

Nanofactory
A Nanofactory is a self contained factory that can take in raw materials (such as metals, ore and minerals), a design and from those make any object (from generator parts through to weapons). 
The Nanofactory may also be used to recycle metals from objects that are no longer of use. While creating, the Nanofactory should be kept as still as possible. A part can take between 10 minutes and 10 hours, depending on complexity. 
A Nanofactory cannot make a part that is larger than itself although once creates the parts can be assembled into something much larger. Nanofactories come in a huge variety of sizes that fit into one of three size groups:
Pocket: For creating weapons, parts for Grav Bikes and cars and small gadgets. Cost: 2500. Encumbrance: 2
Mech Bay: For creating any vehicle part, building and space craft parts. Cost: 50 000.
Orbital: For creating huge space superstructures. Cost: 10 000 000+ (more if you are a long way from civilisation).
Using Nanofactories
To create something using a Nanofactory, roll the appropriate Systems skill for the piece you are creating. If you are designing the item then you will need a Design skill check too. To create the design, you will need a Gaiacard.
For example, you wish to create a brand new sighting system for a gun. Roll Weapon Design first and if successful roll Weapon Systems to create the piece.
Harnesses
Carrying lots of Tech items can eat up your encumbrance. A tech harness is a discrete series of straps that can be worn under clothing and armour (but not Powered Armour). Inorganic items can be made to stick to the harness and released when needed. More expensive harnesses use delicate Grav fields to help reduce the mass of the items, increasing the amount that can be carried.

Grav Field Generator
A Grav field generator changes the gravity within a bubble. The size of the bubble that can created depends on the power of the generator but the gravity strength can be anything from zero to 10 times Earth's gravity (0g to 10g). 
It takes 3 seconds (1 turn) to turn on or off, so items don't immediately slam into each other. The edge of the bubble is very distinct, anything outside the bubble will behave as normal. While switched on, the Grav Field Generator cannot be moved.
The Grav Field Generator can be used to make working in a micro G environment (such as space or disabled space craft) much easier.

Med Kits
Med Kits help medics repair people. Each Med Kit gives a bonus to any Skill check in the Medical Skill Tree. The larger the Med Kit, the easier it is for the Medic to heal people. The top end Tech Kits can heal a bunch of Hit Points each day. The contents includes:
Med Scanner
Affectionately known as the 'Wibbly-Wee', the Med Scanner performs a non-invasive scan of a human or bionic infrastructure. It can detect any medical problem from toxins to neurological breakdown. It helps the Medic quickly diagnose the most urgent problems and deal with them.
Fleshfixer
The Fleshfixer is a mulit-tool that allows the Medic to cut, seal, fuse, coagulate human or bionic flesh in any way. It's the ultimate surgical tool.
Hypo
The Hypo is a modern injection device for insert Genejelly into the blood stream quickly.
Genejelly
A blue mush that can be programmed in an instant to destroy diseases in the patient. The genetic code of the patient provides a blue print that makes the jelly's healing ability powerful. You can consume Genejelly, inject it or rub it into the skin. Genejelly can also be used as a powerful pain reliever. Best of all is that Genejelly can be made using any Bioreorganiser.

Beamer Technology
Beaming is the act of moving something between two points without moving through normal space. Beaming turns the item into its energy pattern equivalent and fires it down a beam of energy to the new location. The beam can pass through solid objects.
Beamer technology is expensive and uses a huge amount of energy. It is not common place, used mostly by high tech expeditionaries and corporations. The general public rarely see any beamer technology but highly paid expeditionary teams use it for ammunition and equipment.
Jamming and Reliability
Beaming is not a reliable technology because the further the beam stretches the more likely it can be corrupted. As the beam reaches its limit, cosmic radiation interferes with the energy pattern of the beam, with catastrophic affects on the item. People are rarely beamed across open space, the Imperium use beaming in emergencies and also beam people down flux cable wires for moving people quickly through large military spacecraft. The Imperium use Droid-safe beaming.
Beamer equipment can be jammed easily (and will be by Droids by default) but jamming can be localised. Jamming beamers will also jam Prospace Communications, so it is easy to tell if the local area is being jammed. For example, if pirates blockade a planet, then jamming will occur in orbit only, beaming on the surface will still work.
10 on a D10 for failure
When using a civilian beamer system, roll a D10 and on a 10, the system fails and if anything arrives at all, it will be a grey sludge.
Rampart Beamer Systems
Rampart are a technology company that specialises in beamer technology. Each gadget can be a source, a destination or both. A source supplies ammunition and equipment while a destination acts as the end point. For example, the Spacecraft beamer spike is a source, the magazine is a destination and the case  is both source and destination. You do not need to beam to a destination, you can beam to anywhere.
Beamer spike
Fitted to a space craft, the beamer spike can beam any inorganic object from within the spacecraft to anywhere within 500km (covers any orbit to surface). It can be mounted anywhere that has access a spacecraft-level of generator.
Cost: 100 000
Rarity: 55%
Range: 500km
Type: Source
Beamer Case Pod
A beamer case looks like a normal suitcase but acts as source for beaming ammo and other small objects. To beam ammo, it will only beam to a beamer magazine. To beam other small objects, it uses a Gaiacard as a way of locking to a target. The beamer case will normally be left in the back seat of a car or in an apartment rather than carried around.
The case pod is also a destination and can be set to automatically top up from a Beamer spike mounted on a spacecraft.
Cost: 25 000
Rarity: 50%
Range: 100km
Type: Source and Destination
Capacity: 800 x 2.2 or 600 x 5.5 or 500 x 7.4 or 1000 energy
Range: 10km from pod to magazine
Encumbrance: 5
Beamer Magazine
The beamer magazine clips into any firearm and feeds the weapon with ammunition at the rate of fire. The magazine operates like a normal magazine, if connection to the beamer source is lost then it can be used as a normal magazine. You only need one beamer magazine as it has a universal clip.
Cost: 10 000
Rarity: 60%
Type: Destination
Capacity: As per normal weapon.
Encumbrance: As per normal weapon.
