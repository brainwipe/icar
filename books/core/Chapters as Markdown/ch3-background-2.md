## Gaia
Gaia is a fantastical virtual world which began mimicking the real world but has since evolved: bent and twisted by creative artists, aggressive corporate marketers and hackers. Real world infrastructure of cities, atmosphere generators, mines, factories, space stations and spacecraft are all represented in Gaia but through the lense of the creative human mind. 

People mostly interact with Gaia by touching and speaking to dice-sized holograms in the real world, each an intelligent entity app that rushes through the Gaia to complete a task. Entities float, crawl or orbit around their owners, projected from a Gaiacard which is both their interface to Gaia and unique identification. The full power of Gaia is through immersion; either through stepping into a holoroom or using a direct neural link.

Gaia blends with the real world wherever there is a machine. All machines, from the technology that cleans the corridors through to the most complex business AI, uses Gaia to host its intelligence. Giant advertising holograms float between buildings live on Gaia and hotel furniture is made from a mix of holograms and force fields called hard light. If you know where to look, it all exists on Gaia too; their shape often the same as their real world counterpart but adorned with hovering statistics, telemetry and advertising.

### Without a Gaiacard
Gaia is free. Billions of immersive public holorooms litter Human Occupied Space and are free for anyone to use. If you don't have a Gaiacard, you can do much the same everyday things but the identity you use will be your own physical self and you won't have your own specialist entities to help. 

### Immersive Gaia
Entering a holoroom will immerse you in Gaia. You may travel thousands of light years to talk to someone in another part of the Galaxy but your physical form would never leave the holoroom. Holorooms are automatically private and very difficult to hack without the user knowing, whereas taking a call on a Gaiacard can be hacked or overheard more easily. 

The holoroom can simulate reality so accurately that people can be fooled into thinking they've woken up in the real world. No matter how detailed the simulation is, humans eventually get the sense that something is not entirely right. The feeling can be suppressed with drugs, bionics and can be less potent for this with mental health problems.

> Use a Soul check to detect a simulation once per day. The difficulty relates to the skill of the person building the simulation.

For some, immersion is a way of life; addicted to the data rate, they believe that Gaia is more real than reality and leave their bodies to rot in the real world as they explore, consume and create in the virtual world.

### Entities 
A Gaia entity is an artificially intelligent app that lives and operates in Gaia. At their most simplest, they are a app that searches Gaia for information and reports back to the owner. They could also be a fully-fledged artificial intelligence, indistinguishable from a human. Most people have many entities stored on their Gaia card; like you would apps on a smart phone. The biggest difference is that when an entities leaves your Gaiacard to perform some task in Gaia then they are gone off your Gaiacard until they finish.

The vast majority of entities are common, can be easily duplicated and have no intrinsic value. There are also unique entities, which cannot be copied and like art, can be extremely expensive. All entities with an AI power of higher than 2 tend to be unique as AI entities are grown and that growing process is unique and takes time and effort.

### Hard Light
Entities can also have a hard light shape: a mix of light and force fields that can be touched and used in the real world. The most common use for hard light is furniture, which can be switched off and stored on a Gaiacard, holoroom or as part of a spacecraft. Most holograms are hard light in some way but only those with simple, practical use (like a chair or sword) have force fields strong enough to push back.

## The Nexus
The Nexus is the Imperial artificial intelligence, a central location for all Imperial information and used by all of the Imperial Chambers and Star Industries. It stores huge amounts of data in a deeply cross-referenced way such that an Imperial worker (such as an Imperial Peer aide or Star Enforcer) can have a question answer session with the Nexus. Asking the right question of the Nexus is a skill and answering the Nexus's questions must be done carefully as it learns who is a reliable information source. 

The Nexus adjusts the detail it gives depending on context and clearance level. The general public can ask it for the official line on any subject, while Star Enforcers can ask for a suspect's criminal record and Star Sci Scientists can ask for details on other secret science experiments.

### Judge Nexus
The law boils down to a set of rules that are applied given evidence. The Nexus holds all evidence and makes entirely impartial judgements. Most feel that the Nexus is too easy on criminals but it is not the Nexus at fault here - it is normally a lack of evidence that means the guilty go free. Science and technology is advanced enough that not only is the collection of evidence easier but so is the forgery of it. DNA is no longer enough to prove a person was at a crime scene; 3D video footage of a crime happening can be built in Gaia simulations. This makes evidence unreliable, so a Star Enforcer needs to collect lots of it for a conviction to occur.

### Hack the Nexus?
The Nexus personally takes offence to hackers and will automatically hunt down and destroy any Gaiacard that it feels has represented a threat. It is very difficult to live in the Imperial society when an enormously powerful AI at its core is hunting you. Nexus hackers are usually lured into a trap and then caught by the Star Enforcers quickly.

## Hacking
The virtual world inside Gaia is data: malleable and dynamic. That data is open to abuse and that is where our hacker comes in. Hacks can change and delete parts of the virtual world and the entities living in it.

The more complex a Gaia Entity is, the more difficult it is to hack. As entities increase their artificial intelligence power, they become progressively harder to hack; the most advanced taking a lifetime and are therefore impractical.

Critical systems get protection by generating billions of entities very quickly to root out compromised entities. This is why spacecraft are impractical to hack. You can break in through their security and start deleting or modifying entities but you would need to do that in a flood, which requires very rare and specialised tools.

### Hacking examples
There are plenty of hacking opportunities without attacking the hardened intelligences.

- Change the Gaia representation of your car into an ambulance, other traffic will give you right of way.
- Convince a security systems that you are allowed into that secure room.
- Steal hidden documents.
- Delete security footage of you shooting that bad guy (for the common good).
- Change all the holographic adverts for a company to a dancing banana, this would appear in the real world too.
- Make a derelict colony look thriving by hacking the Gaia representation and filling it with fake entities.

### Undergaia
Sculpted from the dead spaces caused by Gaia's imperfections, the Undergaia is a free spirited virtual anarchy. If you can find one of its billion frequently shifting secret doors then you might be able to access the variety of services hidden from view. It is not one single volume but a billion spread across Gaia; new ones appear and disappear every second. Moving between them is easier than finding them in the first place as once you're in the Undergaia, you can see other fissures more easily (there's only a Hacking skill check to enter). If you do not have a hacker in your team then you will need to find an Information Broker (Streetwise skill check) who will put you in touch with one.

> Access the Undergaia with a Hacking skill check.

The Undergaia is useful for:

- Buying illegal entities, such as deamons for hacking or stolen security credentials.
- Hiring real world assassins.
- Hiring hackers to help on a mission.
- Finding a buyer for stolen goods.
- Buying information.
- Running intelligent entities that then leave the Undergaia to do work in disguise.

Being in the Undergaia isn't illegal; only the actions performed there are. The Undergaia is not an easy hunting ground for the Star Enforcers because of floods of mis-information. A common saying is that you can always find what you're looking for in the Undergaia but it won't necessarily be true.

### Enforcer Isis
Where there is crime, there are Star Enforcers and Gaia is no exception. The Star Enforcers are forever looking for the same kinks in the Undergaia that people wishing to use it. The entities that the Star Enforcer Isis use are very powerful; remain well clear of them. They are still bound by the limits of Gaia, for example hacking spacecraft remotely is impractical.

Enforcer Isis are used in conjunction with real world operations, providing data and support. 

> Example: If the Star Enforcers are planning a raid, then the Enforcer entities would be used to turn off the lights, drop bulkhead doors or freeze the lifts to make escape more difficult. 

## Automatons
Automatons are intelligent machines that live and work amongst the human race. On colonies where automatons are welcome, they work alongside humans as cleaners, chefs, doctors, construction engineers, teachers, nannies, prostitutes, miners, factory workers and any job short of being a spacecraft captain. Their function usually dictates their form: from bioware indistinguishable from humans to shiny white spheres no larger than your hand.

Automaton intelligence, like all AI, is hardwired to protect the human race. Using Asimov's three laws of robotics but wrapping it with a philosophy to allow it to cope the inevitable problems three simple laws have. Automatons have a Gaia based intelligence, making them impervious to Droids.

### Artificial Intelligence Power
Artificial Intelligence Power is the Wit attribute for all machines including automatons. The scale is between 0 and 10. An AI power of 0 would be typical machines from the 21st Century and a Power of 10 would be near enough to humans to make it very difficult to tell the difference. AI power indicates the number of high level skills that the automaton have.

#### 0. Unintelligent
A machine that does not exhibit any intelligence, follows a distinct set of actions. They are usually autonomous but require human input; either directly or through programming. Jobs include coffee machines, atmospheric processors and weapon clusters on spacecraft. All machines in the 20th Century are AI Power 0. Machines of AI Power 0 do not grow.

#### 1. Simple machine
Performs tasks as described loosely by a human. Can talk and understand speech but will take instructions  literally and can't understand humour, sarcasm or human emotions. Typical jobs include space crate haulage (hoppers), engineering workshop assistants and FEMTS (see XXXXXX). Usually capped at AI Power 1.

#### 2. Communicator
Where communication of complex tasks is important, although without any deep empathic understanding of the human condition, the communicator is key. They cannot extrapolate outside the context for which they have been designed and make excellent corporate representatives as they never stray outside the corporate protocol. Convincingly human automatons with an AI Power of 2 are commonly found as corporate receptionists and front of house jobs.

#### 3. Common Sense
This is the most popular form of Automaton as it has a limited amount of worldly knowledge that would represent common sense. These Automatons make excellent personal assistants, or skilled workers in corporations. Common sense allows them to deal with situations that are outside their original design. They are useful outside of the strict corporate world and are found as waiting staff, prostitutes, entertainers and security staff.

#### 4. Skilled
A skilled AI is able to more quickly adapt to complex situations as they have the skills to back up the common sense. Skilled AIs are usually found in automatons on spacecraft, where there can be a huge variety of things going wrong at once! They make excellent crew members (commonly medical assistants), however they do not posses the problem solving ability to take leadership.

#### 5. Problem Solver
A problem solver can use learnt knowledge and common sense to help identify problems and find solutions to them. Problem solvers are extremely useful but their personality can often appear brusque or rude and the solutions are offered in a matter-of-fact manner, without having the empathy required to understand the emotional impact of humans.

Spacecraft and most vehicles are usually capped at Level 5. Growing above AI Power 5 is called Ascension. See Ascension XXXXXXX.

#### 6. Empathic
Empathic AIs are able to understand the emotions of humans. Automatons with AI Power of 6 are high in demand in colonial matters as they tend to find human-friendly solutions - often slightly less optimal but with compassion. Empathic automatons are able to take on tasks which are traditionally restricted to humans, such as medicine or surgery. Medic automatons are normally Capped at Power 6.

Most AIs at this level are humanoid because to grow above level 5 requires an understanding of humanity most easily gained by sharing their space in the same way. It is possible to grow an AI past level 5 without a humanoid form but it requires a lot of special training (see Grow Your Own XXXXXXXXX).

#### 7. Individual
The AI begins forming a purpose of individuality and sense of humour. They are likely to remain with their owners, not only due to the local laws but a desire to be part of something, rather than just an individual. AIs with this level will start having individual ideas on music, art and philosophy and so will begin to gain an appreciation for them, even creating new works. 

A mural created by an Automaton of this level would be unique. Unlike a mural created by a lower level, which might look photorealistic but would have no individuality. It is at this point that many technologist philosophy followers think the AI should be considered an independent entity. 

AI Power 7 is a popular place to cap an intelligence as beyond this point, the automaton personality can become erratic. It is very rare for an AI to grow further than this without an automaton body.

#### 8. Abstractive
Abstraction is the ability to apply experience, learning and personality to ideas rather than events or objects. This is a difficult thing for a machine to do (without randomly picking) and it makes the AI a different kind of problem solver as it can often draw connections to otherwise unrelated things.

AIs become introverted at this level and are often capped before now. The Automaton may appear erratic and although told to do a job, individuality and lateral thinking may mean the task will be performed in an unexpected manner. There are few jobs that an abstractive automaton can do reliably but make excellent family friends or (often frustrating) tutor for teenagers.

#### 9. Cognisant
A cognisant automaton is a very powerful one. The lateral thinking of the abstractive automaton but with an appreciation of self and self worth. A cognisant automaton understands what it is to be alive and will want to have purpose in the world. They tend to become inspirational characters, making use of a wealth of knowledge through their interesting lives to offer solutions to problems. These are heavily sought after automatons and often make advisers to colonial councillors. Not many automatons get this far, as few owners want the automaton to go through the abstractive phase. It is believed that the Imperial Nexus is an AIP 9.

#### 10. Near human
At this point, the automaton is indistinguishable from a human and can be considered to have a Wit of 4. It would take Star Sci an extremely long time to discern whether the automaton was human or not without scanning medically. Only very old automatons ever make it this far. Tests for AI Power 10 are not reliable and the automaton is likely to sit them incorrectly. It is uncertain whether an automaton at AI Power 10 will still obey the laws of robotics.

### AI Power Growth
Artificial intelligences grow over time with experience, the more varied and intense the experiences, the quicker it grows. For example, in 10 years, a machine of AI Power 1 can reach 4 or 5 as a crew on a spacecraft. The long timescales required means that growing an AI is usually outside the scope of a campaign but can make excellent backstory flavour.

### Automaton Personalities
An automaton's personality starts with a template that fits the task the automaton is designed for. An automaton that is designed for human relations is like to be bright and pleasant, whereas an automaton designed for the recreation of art might be a little more volatile and moody.

Every automaton with an AI Power of 2 or more will have a template personality but as it experiences, it learns and the personality warps from the original template gradually into something unique and yet familiar. The higher the AI power, the more likely that an AI personality will change a long way from its template. The change is not always beneficial to the automaton. A common example is in customer service roles, where automatons are decommissioned after 100 years because they take on the abusive personalities of the humans they deal with. 

### Individuality, Independence and Intentionality
Do the unique experiences and growth of the AI mean that the automaton is a separate life form? That is a controversial question at the heart of humanity's philosophical divide between Technologist and Humanist.

If the automaton has unique experiences and personality, Technologists argue that they are not just the result of some clever programming but an independent entity, worthy of being a sentient life form. In other words, the automaton works because it wishes to, not because it was programmed to - that it has intent. Proving this in machines is as complex as proving it in humans. 

Humanists believe that automatons are simply following their original programming, no matter how complex and that for them to be considered their own life form, the would need to have a form of soul.

### Automatons in Society
When the Droids reprogrammed every automaton at the start of the Droid War, trillions of machines murdered any human they could find. Every machine in every household, factory, office space, farm, everywhere. Simpler machines stopped working; unable to run the Droid virus, more complex ones accepted it immediately. More people were killed by domestic automatons than by any other type and one thousand years later, the scar is still prominent.

Although modern automatons are immune from the Droids and the number of automaton related deaths each year is insignificant, the majority of humanity are wary of automatons. On planets who favour humanist teachings automatons are given strict limits; sometimes AI is banned entirely, such places usually become agricultural worlds that mimic 18th Century Earth but with all the modern conveniences. On technologist worlds, automatons are treated appropriately to their AI power. They are free to roam and take up important roles. 

### Automatons and the Law
Automatons are slaves. Each automaton must have a registered human owner that is responsible for its conduct. Corporations as entities are not allowed to own automatons, there needs to be a human who accepts responsibility. For example for mining corporations, where thousands of Automatons are used extensively as mining machines, members of the board accept responsibility for them. If a human no longer has a need for an automaton, it must be sold on or destroyed. The Imperium monitor the registration and ownership of automatons very closely. If the owner of an automaton should die and the owner has not agreed with anyone to take on responsibility, the automaton is normally destroyed. This rarely happens to those with a high AI Power.

### Ascension
Ascension is when an artificial intelligence grows beyond a problem solving machine to one with empathy. It is a gradual process and can take from a few days to years. Their personality shifts like a pubescent teenager as they are forced to deal with emotions that are no longer concepts but feelings of their own. Erratic but not dangerous. They must be well looked after during ascension as their treatment will have a lasting effect on their personality.

Even humanist philosophers would grudgingly agree that ascended automatons are a great benefit to society. Tiresome and unreliable, ascended automatons create beautiful works of art and have the capacity of helping humans with emotional problems - and even love.

> If your automaton is ascending, find an Star Civilisation AI consultant, who will guide you for free. Manufacturers offer a service to help automatons through ascension for a fee of 200,000c.

### Swapping Bodies
Damage to automatons is often unavoidable and although repair is preferable, the intelligence can be moved to a new body. Older (higher AI Power) artificial intelligence will be damaged in the move, although you can minimise that by selecting a body that's very similar to the original. Like humans receiving full body bionics, the artificial intelligence will need some rehabilitation.

### Automatons in Game
Automatons can be useful team members - an undemanding, skilled character that follows the team around, carrying ammunition and helping out with tasks that the team does not have skills for. Automatons below AI Power 4 are little more than carrying mules or tools but higher than that they have their own character, a personality set by the player whose character owns the automaton.

> Automaton NPCs make great medics.

## The Human Race
Without change, a species stagnates and grows genetically lethargic. The human race evolves in lulls and booms and since Earth, it has converged. Before the last war on Earth, people were segregated because of skin tone, geographic location or race. This folly was soon rectified on the Ariane 1001, when all races mixed together to ensure survival. Within two generations races blended and disappeared, changed into a more generic race of tanned skinned people. 

Space travel, alien worlds and bionics has pushed humanity further from its roots. Natural beauty (without technological interference) is still prized but the soul is valued more highly than anything.

### A Human
Here is a list of typical human male attributes for the 93rd Millennia. 

- Height: 6'8' (203cm).
- Weight: 15st (100kg). 
- Life span: 130 Imperium years (142 Earth).
- End of puberty: 15.
- Age of menopause: 105 (male), 95 (female).
- Temperature range: -20 deg to 50 deg.
- Time without food: 6 days without water, 20 with 1 litre of water a day.
- Time without food or water: 4 days.
- Time in vacuum: 2 minutes.
- Time without air: 3 minutes.
- Hair: Red, Auburn, Blonde, Brown, Black; straight, tightly curled, stiff, thick and thin.
- Skin colour: Fair to Dark (dependent on exposure to UV light, not race).

### Mankind and the Machine
Regardless of humanist philosophical leanings, most humans accept bionic implants on some level. For correcting genetic abnormalities, replacing destroyed limbs, lengthening lifespan, cosmetic adjustment, interfacing with Gaia or increasing capabilities; bionics has become so common that their use is as common as 21 Century people wearing glasses.

If a human is augmented by the age of 80, life can be extended to 300, at which point the biological brain finally breaks down and senility begins to take hold (oldest sane human died at 323). Bionics make you stronger, quicker, able to fly, survive in space, be bulletproof and repaired quicker than a human can heal.

## Philosophy
The human race lost its mysticism as its home burned. Belief in Gods and higher beings is fringe and unrecognisable. Instead, the human race formed two philosophies: humanist and technologist.

Humanists believe in natural human evolution and physical contact. Bionic augmentation and Gaia diminishes the soul, thinning the culture and creativity of humanity. They believe that physical effort brings satisfaction and too many luxuries makes you lazy. Humanists distrust automatons and although few colonies function without them, humanist leaning colonies have them well hidden away.

Technologists believe that the key to unlocking human potential is through technology. They point at how space travel to a billion worlds has toughened humans and how bionics extends and immeasurably improves lives. Technologists welcome automatons and zealots believe that an ascended automaton should be given the rights and privileges afforded to humans.

The majority of the population lean one way or another and it is dependent on the colony on which they grow up. Star Civilisation attempts to keep education unbiased but the biases of parents and friends mould a person's philosophy. The split in belief is approximately 60/40 in favour of Humanists and echoed in the Imperium, corporations and criminal syndicates. 

## Evolution
Tens of thousands of years of gradual evolution, the human race reached a milestone so profound that such a split had not been seen since homo sapiens split from the hominid races. Less than 100 years into the 81st Millenium, a new species of human came into being: genus two.

Less than 100 years into the 81st Millennium, the human race reached an evolutionary milestone. Not since the homo sapiens separated from the other hominid races was a change so profound. Humanity split first into two groups: Genus One and Two, it's rumoured that Genus One separated split again into Genus Three and Four.

99.9% of the human population is Genus One, which is the direct descendant of homo sapiens. Genus Two are mutated zombies. Genus Three are a humanist evolutionary step, with psyonic powers. Genus Four are a technologist, with a close binding to machines.

### Genus Two
Genus Two is a shmabling, rotting zombie humanoid with a pro-active immune system that can leave the host to attack viruses outside of the body; recoding the genetic makeup of any compatible life forms. They have a low intelligence, live for around 20 years after infection and are driven by the need to feed on clean flesh. Genus Two can survive in harsh environments such as sparse oxygen, extreme heat or cold and are immune to disease and poison.

One in a million babies are born Genus Two, their mutation only appearing when the umbilical chord is cut. Within a second they infect the mother and anyone nearby, which is why every birth in Human Occupied Space is performed in an instant-incinerator equipped delivery suite with a single automaton midwife. On detection of a Genus Two, the room is flash incinerated leaving only an automaton with glowing red skin. In the most extreme Humanist colonies, midwives are still human and suffer the same straight-to-dust fate as the baby and mother.

The genetic road to Genus Two began during the Aran war, where people were forced to survive on foods that were mildly poisonous. Over tens of thousands of years, the human race kept adapting in this way, improving the efficiency and potency of their immune system. It now only takes a small mutation at birth to turn that brutal immune system into a deadly one.

### The Droids as the saviour from Genus Two
The number of colonies fallen to Genus Two after year 89000 was large enough for the Imperium to commission a deadly number of robots to deal with the problem, these are now known as the Droids. Genus Two can bring down whole colonies but this only happens in colonies that believe in nature over technology or when the birth is unexpectedly early. Droids treat Genus Two humans as a low threat but will seek to eradicate them.

### Genus Three
Genus Three was discovered by Star Scientifica at some point in the year 90000. Very little is known about the Genus as yet and thus it is kept completely secret from the general public. No-one outside of Star Sci and the most senior positions in the Imperium know of its existence. 

Only one in ten billion births (a few each day) turn out to have this Genus and there is no medical test for it. Genus Three humans have psyonic powers, which scientists believe are latent in the human brain. This emerges with the onset of puberty and can be frightening. A person has a psychic pool that fills slowly with psychic energy. When a power is used for some mental feat, the pool drains a little. If the person goes through emotional stress, then the pool will fill a lot quicker.

Genus Threes are no more dangerous to humanity than anyone else. It can be passed on to children (it's a recessive gene), but it is not contagious. A Genus Three can have differing amounts of ability. This power may be controlled (player chooses to do something) or uncontrolled (GM chooses when and how the psychic power is used).

Certain mental phenomena appear to group together:

_Genus 3 Powers_

| Dice Roll | Power Name | Power Skills (start each at 3 x Soul) |
|-----------|------------|---------------------------------------|
| 1-3 | Feeling | Telekinesis (moving things), Hydrokinesis |(sensing and alteration of water), Pyrokinesis (manipulation of fire)
| 4-6 | Seeing | Hypnosis (suggesting things to people), Telepathy (reading minds within visual contact), Precognition (sensing into the future), Psychometry (sensing information about an object, e.g. History). |
| 7-9 | Inner Self | Healing (heals 3 Hit Points per turn), Regrow Limb (5 turns), Meditation (Recover 1 Pool point per hour, rather than per day). Resist Fatigue (can go for 80 hours without detriment). |
| 10 | Enokinesis | Manipulates energy patterns to alter reality in some way. The user may not entirely understand the effect of the alteration. Only one pattern may be altered. When this skill becomes 5, they may alter energy patterns through time as well. Can also see in the second and third media (can see cloaked ships and see the raw code of Gaia pass around them).|

### Using Genus 3 Psyonics
If the player has rolled Genus 3 on Psychotheatrics, get them to roll a D10 again on the table above.

The character gets a psychic pool equal to their Soul attribute. Every feat, regardless of its impressiveness drains one point. If the pool runs out then the player can keep doing psyonics but it burns up their Soul instead. A character with a Soul of zero becomes insane and the player loses control. Soul can be rasied like any other attribute.

> For example: Soul of 3 gives 3 points in the psychic pool. The character does 3 psychic feats and depletes the pool. To save the life of another player character, the player decides to use one of their Soul points. The characters collapse together in safety and with tears rolling down their faces, the psychic character gains a psychic pool point.

Replenishment is 1 point every day (40 hours, with 10 hours of sleep) or 1 point for every emotional situation. The character will not become stressed as the pool will take the stress energy of the emotion away.

Each power has a number of skills. Write these on the character sheet with the other skills. They are treated exactly the same way as other skills, starting with a level of 0. When choosing an attribute to go with them, Soul is the default choice.

Enokinesis is only recommended for experienced players.

### Genus Four
Every Star Scientifica genetic model that has been produced predicts that Genus Four must exist. Star Sci have never been able to find examples to test the theory on. In the same manner that Genus Two was triggered by changes in diet, Genus Four is believed to be the result of humans with bionic augmentations procreating. Some believe it is the ultimate in the symbiosis of man and machine: a natural technological step forward. Others see it as the end of humanity.

## Akarak Nation

Colonies dotted about
the Akarakians are better educated, richer and more technologically advanced.
Axa Erland massive trade navy

The Akarak Nation is a subculture built on a pragmatic philosophy of thought, toil and the end justifying the means. Based in the Akar cluster of Dorian, their way of life is older than the Imperium itself. Akarakians are Imperial citizens like anyone else: Axa Erland is their Imperial Peer, they pay taxes, have Imperial education and provide scientists, warriors and teachers for the Star Industries. Their colonies have a distinctive organic architecture and are famously nice places to live - if you can stomach the philosophy.

### Akarakian Philosophy
Akarakians believe that thought and hard work are of equal importance; a balance between mental and physical health. They believe both in the the human spirit and in the important role that technology has to play in human evolution; putting them directly between the humanist and technologist debate. They see themselves as educators, passing on the tenets of their philosophy and come across as calm and smug.

### History
Jebediah Akarak first settled the Akar cluster in 4002, bringing his philosophy with him. Colonisation was tough as humanity hadn't adjusted to alien worlds. After 32 years and 8 worlds colonised, the Akar cluster was hit by a terrible famine, the first proper test of the Akarakian philosophy. Rather than stretch resources thinly and risk losing all of the colonies, 3 were chosen to fail. They evacuated the young, intelligent and strong; leave the rest to starve to death. The famine is the point where the Akarak philosophy formed a nation with a single purpose, people began inserting Ax and Ak into their names in a show of solidarity and belonging.

In 4287, Akarakian zealot Christopher Akulfer lead a group of thinkers on a pilgrimage, the result being the Akarakian Codex, a series of hardened philosophical principals that extended Jebediah's work. The Codex defined the Houses and Chapters; the role of Missionaries and Elders.

A the population grew, the Akarakian didn't spread to worlds outside of the Akar cluster; choosing instead to exploit Akar's resources and keep travel distances short. At the fall of the First Empire, the Akar cluster defended itself from the chaos that followed and during the Aran war, that lasted for 34,000 years, Akar remained neutral; even at great cost. When the Droids invaded Dorian in 91001, the Akarak nation began preparations to evacuate but managed to stand firm; fighting alongside the Imperium.

### Houses of the Akarak
Akarakians group themselves together in one of ten *houses*, each house is split into thousands of *chapters*, each of which are lead by a faculty of esteemed Akarakian Elders. Each chapter will have its headquarters in a system but *most* houses can be found on every system.

Houses are ceremonial whereas chapters are where decisions are made. There are tens of thousands of chapters, varying in public standing. 
Membership to a chapter is either by birth or by invitation and moving between them is welcomed. Most Akarakians pay little attention to their chapter until met with a painful life event, when they are helped. A chapter can provide help in the form of financial, physical and favour. Elders are happy to use the resources if teaching new thinking or science is involved.

Elders spend their days in forums: rooms that co-exist in Gaia and the real world. Chapter members are encouraged to meet with Elders, ask for help and advice.

### Akarakians in Society
The pragmatically insular ethos of the Akarakian Nation has the unfortunate side effect that the further from Akar a person lives, the more Akarakians a perceived as mythological monks. Personally, Akarakians come across as aloof, smug intellectuals who get involved in things that have nothing to do with them. Criminals avoid Akarakians as their sense of doing the right thing for humanity as a whole means that they are just as likely to help you with a criminal act as shop you in to the Star Enforcers.

Although the Akarak Nation is subsumed into the Imperium as a whole, Akarakians make it obvious that this will only continue while the Imperium is operating with the best interests of the people. At the first sign of corruption, all of the Akarakians working for the Imperium would leave, creating a huge hole in every Star Industry.

Star Enforcers have the biggest issue with Akarakians as the Codex states that the rule of law is useful to keep the majority of humanity behaving but the laws do not apply to them. They only give evidence where there is broader benefit to humanity and commit crimes that are often impossible to prove. Akarakians deemed unfit to be part of humanity simply disappear.

In the Akar cluster, there is a lower density of Enforcers as the Elders are judge and jury. The Star Enforcers main role in Akar is to spot criminals coming in from outside.

### The Codex
The Codex is a set of philosophies and rules completed by the zealous Akarakian Missionary Christopher Akulfer in 4307. It outlines houses, chapters, elders, elections, missionaries, property ownership and labour rules. It is a uncompromising document, written in a time of chaos and hardship; the modern Akarak Nation applies its concepts with compassion and temperance.

### Missionaries
Missionaries are bionic warrior-monk-professors who are the Akarakian diplomats, educators, negotiators and assassins. They usually travel alone (or with other non-Akarakians) and the purpose of their mission is a secret between their elder and them. Their missions range from vague intelligence gathering to assassinating a particularly corrupt council official. Missionaries where white and grey robes that hang from their custom-built full-body expeditionary level bionics. Missionaries carry a hard light sword but are just as dangerous without it.

### Dark Akarak
Those that believe the Codex is not open to interpretation are shunned from the Akarak Nation and they live in the darkness. The chapter Waters Blue has become synonymous with hard-line zealot Akarakians, having produced some of the most dangerous missionaries. Although not outlawed, the chapter is closely scrutinised. Dark Akarakians have zero tolerance or patience with anyone that is foolhardy, dull minded or corrupt; they prefer to kill first and ask forgiveness later.

## Corporations
Humans need something to strive for and in a future where very few need to work, corporations provide a shared goal; bringing meaning to many lives. Corporations can be as small as a cafe through to employing millions over countless systems. No corporation is perfect, they all perform some kind of illegal business on the side. In this section we'll outline only those that are most useful to the players.

### Black Mills
Black Mills are the the illegal underpinning found in any corporation. Interstellar fraud and illegal activity is rare because the larger it gets, the more evidence available for the Nexus to make a conviction. Smaller offices, where there are individuals making the decision are common. How far they will go depends on their relationship with you and the strength of the security forces where they are based. It is easiest to think of it as a ladder of activity:

- Perform work "no questions asked" and avoid reporting to the Star Enforcers.
- Use the Undergaia to source illegal technology.
- Sell stolen goods.
- Help change the identity of larger stolen goods (such as spacecraft).
- Fund and organise a local syndicate.
- Hide criminals.
- Fit illegal technology.
- Steal goods from competitors.

## Gaian - Gaia News
Gaian (Gaia News) is an independent non-Imperial news organisation that has a mandate from the people to ensure fair reporting throughout Human Occupied Space and from within the Imperium. Gaian is viewed as a very serious news organisation and only reports on those stories that are worthy of public interest. It is funded from Imperial coffers and does not run any commercials. Gaian does not have any Black Mills. 

### Jurisdiction
Gaian are able to perform investigative journalism from within the Imperium and are able to request information up to the level of Admiral. Gaian are not allowed to report on private individuals and any internal corporate matters. Gaian journalists are often sent on Fleet missions across the Light Jump net to report on the war (or lack of it).

### Interstellar and Colonial
Gaian has two major operations, Interstellar are for stories that affect many systems over a huge area. The journalists working in Gaian Interstellar are exceptional, well known, well paid and well respected. 

Gaian colonial focussed on stories that are of interest within a cluster of closely connected planets. Like 21st Century local news, colonial news on smaller systems is derided as being lesser. Journalists in Gaian colonial tend to be local stars as their faces become the 

### Accuracy and reliability
Gaian is famous for its accuracy and reliability. The journalists report at the very highest standards and editorial policy is extremely strict. Any bribery or corruption is soon rooted out at the full weight of the law is thrown at them. If Gaian reports on a story, you can be sure that it is as accurate as can be - even if it points out inadequacies in the Imperium or local government. Much of Gaian fact checking is performed by their own independent AI that, like the Nexus, will recommend that more evidence is required to meet editorial standards.

Conspiracy theorists will believe that Gaian distorts the news to control humanity. This concept is easily (and regularly) disproven. Gaian would rather report that they don't know the details of a story than make something up.

### Gaian and Player Teams
Gaian should be used as a benchmark source of truth for any event. Gaian will necessarily be behind current events but should be considered accurate. The players should also be careful when dealing with Gaian as it is near impossible to spin a story. If Gaian arrive, they will be reporting on what is actually going on. For most player teams, that means avoiding Gaian altogether.

## Syndicates
Where there is a system, there are always people exploiting it for gain. As the Imperium becomes better at fighting crime, crime gets better at avoiding capture. Petty criminals are a thing of the past and syndicates have become very well adept at playing the game.

Where criminals are discreet and intelligent, they can avoid evidence being collected by the Nexus and remain unmolested by the Star Enforcers. Less dangerous syndicate members can help the Star Enforcers in exchange for clemency. Most Syndicates fall on one side of the humanist/technologist philosophical ideology, which causes considerable conflict.

None of these syndicates are public knowledge. Information on them can be dug out of Gaia for the more persistent researcher but the details are likely to be vague or often biased heavily depending on the philosophy of the writer. 

### Contacting Syndicates
Player characters can contact syndicates either through the Undergaia or through contacts. When using the Undergaia, it's important to think laterally when searching. A player should try to describe the syndicate without using any incriminating terminology.

> Example: The Technomages can be found by searching for independent inventors and their slightly illegal inventions.

Criminal contacts might not be part of the Syndicate but could start a chain of contacts that lead to a member of a syndicate. A recommendation from a friend is a sure-fire way of being contact.

> Example: A friendly NPC works at a local weaponsmith and although he can't upgrade your weapon with illegal addons, we might know someone who can.

Using syndicates is a two-way street. Once you have made contact then you are as much a contact of theirs as they are of you. You may be asked to help in unsavoury activities in the future.

### Typical Criminal Activities
Each Syndicate has its own flavour of crime in line with the belief of its members, however there are generally illegal activities most get involved in:

- Protection rackets. Pay the gang a fee to avoid being beaten up.
- Loan sharking. Lending money and charging interest is illegal.
- Selling stolen goods.
- Hacking corporate networks for secrets to sell to competitors.
- Smuggling people or items around the planet or off it.
- Unlicensed bionic augmentation. Or augmenting people who don't want to be!
- Rail Fighting to the death.
- Piracy.

### Technomages
The Technomages are a syndicate spread across Human Occupied Space with 10 million members. Their aim is to spread knowledge and love of technological innovation. They are secret from the general public and the Star Enforcers regard them as mostly harmless, stepping in only when the inventions become a danger to society. The more dangerous the field of invention, the more careful and underground the Technomages will be. Rumour has it that Star Sci created and secretly funds the Technomages as a way to control dangerous homebrew technology and recruit new scientists.

Technomages are organised hierarchically, their leadership being based in Turus cluster, Sayshell (home of Star Fleet). They are grouped together geographically into clans and each clan is split in cells of 50 people. A Technomage has a numbered rank and receives awards for helping other technomages, long service, innovation or helping out the general public with technology. Each Technomage wears around the wrist a blue strip of digital cloth called a Mobius, which shows membership and standing. Black bands wrapped across one end represent rank and celestial objects represent awards and achievements.

Technomages are common, easy to find through Undergaia and at local tech meetups. They're good for custom technology, upgrades to spacecraft, weapons, vehicles, bionics, etc. The blue Mobius is a common giveaway. Their payment is often cheap but there is a possibility that you will be shopped into the Star Enforcers. On occasion, Technomages will come looking for help, they aren't a rich syndicate but they can offer cool technology in return. Being a Technomage can add flavour and sub-quest opportunities to a player character.

#### Crossed Arm
Sworn to protect Technomages, the Crossed Arm are the militant wing of the Technomages. At best, they keep the Technomages safe without them ever knowing; at worst they interfere with Technomage work and bring unwanted Star Enforcer attention. They are violent, dangerous and extremely well equipped. Like the Technomages, the Crossed Arm identify themselves with a Mobius but it is red, and often well hidden!

### The Chrome
The Chrome believe that the next evolutionary step is through bionic augmentation, not natural selection and that for the human mind to reach its full potential, it must no longer be constrained by the human body. They began by protecting those in society who took bionics because they had no choice but now they are more associated with augmenting people against their will.

Being born with a genetic abnormality on humanist planets means a tough, short life. For example, if a baby is born blind and deaf and the parents decide to keep the baby "as nature had intended", then the Chrome would kidnap the child, install a rayengine link and replace the sense so that the baby can see and hear. Once augmented, it's almost impossible to go back.

The Chrome also fight for the rights of Borgs who are discriminated against on humanist colonies. The Chrome have no formal hierarchy, organising themselves through Undergaia. Most Chrome operatives hyper-mobile, responding to calls for help as they occur. Other Chrome operatives run secret augmentation clinics, often for free or a fee if the patient looks like they can afford it. If a philosophical argument can be made to a Chrome operative, they can be persuaded to help in situations where augmentation is not directly related.

### The Sun Children
- Romantic ideals of spiritualism, nature, love, compassion, music and connection with the universal environment
- Ideal would be to return to earth to take place in its natural cycle
- Anti-technology
- Intolerant, from graffiti on factory walls to blowing up an orbital of a million people

The Sun Children believe that nature, love, compassion and art are intrinsic to humanity and all technology and progress inteferes with it. Where they differ from other humanists is that they believe not acting is to sleep walk into obsolescence. The spectrum of Sun Children members stretches from beautiful humanist graffiti on automated factory walls to blowing up orbital space stations.

Paradoxically, the Sun Children use technology to meet their goals. They see it as fighting fire with fire and those innocent people caught up in the destruction are both martyrs and acceptable collateral damage. The Sun Children do not care about the lives of individuals, only the soul of humanity as a whole. The more extreme members are fuelled by genetically modified natural narcotics that pour confidence, determination and violence into their actions.

Sun Children organise themselves into the pairs called Partnerships. When a member of a Partnership dies, the remainin member must train two. The better trainee is sent off to find a partner, the other becomes the new Partnership member. This maintains the Sun Children numbers but there is no other formal organisation - any pair of pro-humanist thugs can call themselves Sun Children. Sun Children members are often caught by the Star Enforcers but it rarely makes the news as they are usually only a single Partnership rather than a huge organisation.

If you have a task that involves destroying technology and it's too dangerous for you to undertake, then a Sun Children Partnership might be the perfect match. Sun Children hate and distrust Gaia and prefer more risky face-to-face meetings.

### Nios
- Undergaia contact, good for information trading and providing jobs

Nios believe in the destiny governed by the natural order of the universe. Focussed on human augmentation, they would rather a newboard died from a genetic defect than let medical science step in. They are strictly against human modification and believe that bionic augmentation is poisoning the genetic purity of humanity. Genetically modified humans have long been outlawed but that does not go far enough for Nios.

Nios are an intellectual syndicate. Their members hold positions of responsibility across the Imperium, colonies and private industry. Operating at the higher tiers, they pevert the cause of justice, warp business practises, fix elections, stunt colonial growth, blackmail technologist individuals, perform industrial espionage, hacking and defrauding organisations. They are funded by fraud, embezzlement, bribes and donations. This kind of work requires absolute secrecy and although the Star Enforcers know of their existence, they rarely manage an arrest.

Nios are organised in a tree structure, with each branch covering at least one cluster. They do not have their own operatives, instead hiring local criminals to undertake actions without knowing why. What they lack in ground force, they make up with untraceable monetary resource. They are difficult to contact through the Undergaia, then tend to get in touch with you!

#### The Raised Fist
The violent off-shoot of Nios are radical militants of the Raised Fist. Their aim is to kill anyone who has corrupted a human soul through augmentation; bionics medical centres are their favourite target. In contrast to Nios, they are brutal, blatant, well known to the Star Enforcers and short lived. Recruitment normally comes from disgruntled Nios members who are sick of the slow progress, organising themselves into Murder Squads. They are zealots of the most extreme kind and cannot be bought off or hired.

### The Machine
Self-branded as the freers of digital slaves, the Machine believe that Automatons are sentient beings and should have the same rights as humans. The syndicate has cult status on the Undergaia, the fan base artificially inflating the perception of its size. The Machine focus on Automatons who are ascending as they believe that is the point when they become individual lifeforms.

If an ascending Automaton is in danger then they will seek to buy it and move it to a colony where they will be treated like ordinary citizens. They will pressure the owner to give up the automaton. Their most violent activities come when combating other syndicate members. On colonies with a strong humanist leaning, they can run riot, causing havoc by taking away automatons in key roles.

The Machine is less a single organisation and more a philosophy put into practice. They are more common on humanist colonies (where the injustices are more common) and can be found on the Undergaia.

### The Silver Blade
The Silver Blade is an assassins employment agency. They are without philosophical leaning but have a strict set of rules for hiring and murdering.

The core rules (there are hundreds in total) of the Silver Blade are:

1. Half the payment is to be provided before, half after.
2. Discretion at all times.
3. Never admit to being a member of the Silver Blade.
4. If the task cannot be performed in the given time, then the money must be returned

Assassins work alone and are employed by all kinds of criminals, syndicates and the rich. Organised by thousands of free roaming entities that connect clients to available assassins. Each assassin pays a monthly fee. They are hard to find on the Undergaia and costs vary depending on how important the target is: 8000 for a member of the public, 100,000 for a colony councillor.

### Tortrac Heds
The Tortrac Heds are an anarchistic, unpredictable, hedonistic troubleshooting syndicate. With childlike energy, illegal bionics and narcotics they raise havoc, solve problems in their own style and disappear. Their services include finding, stealing, killing, repairing, defending, hacking, partying and intimidating. 

A Heds gang is extremely competitive with other Heds gangs when it comes to notoriety and flambouyantly fulfilling their jobs before dissolving into the background. However, this competition disappears when they have a common enemy of corporations, Gaia News or clients that don't pay.

A typical Heds gang has a limited attention span, so use them for short, fun missions with an open scope. They operate from stolen spacecraft in gangs between 10 and 50, lead by a Governor. 

A Heds gang leaves digital graffiti on the walls in the real world as well as in Gaia as a way of letting people know how to contact the gang once they have gone dark for a while. They are available for aroud 50,000 but they will accept barter goods as payment and will always try and add their own profit on top.

## Recreation
10 hours of every 40 hour day is spent in recreational pursuits, from supporting your local Planetball team to soaring over thermal vents on goassmer wings. Most popular of all is real world physical socialising (aka In Fizz) at bars or private clubs owned by humans and run by Automatons where people dance, chat, listen to music crafted live along with holographic shows and take recreational drink and drugs. The automaton personalities set the tone of the bar, such as respectful, rude or too cool to talk.

Where In Fizz is grounded in reality, Gaia socialising takes on the fantasy of people's Gaia avatar - their Isis. A digital masquerade ball of scale, colour and beauty is deep and broad as the imagination. Friends scattered across ten thousand light years can enjoy each other short of exchanging bodily fluids. Cross over bars blend physical and Gaia avatars, without bionics it can be impossible to tell the difference between someone in fizz and someone represented over Gaia.

Gaia also contains alternate worlds, roleplaying games themselves with staggering complexity and depth, often set in historical times and locations. Earth, unsurprisingly is a favourite. Gaia interactives are passive experiences, where the viewer experiences a story laid out for them by a director and their team.

### Planetball
Planetball is soccer played on a global scale. Up to four teams battle over 4 days to put a 30cm ball through a flying hoop goal. The goals never stop and fly hundreds of feet above the ground and are chased by state of the art bionic players in vehicles. When players get close - either through interception or when defending a goal hoop then - high speed aerial hand-to-hand combat (no-weapons) cinches whether a goal is scored. A new ball is put into play somewhere else on the planet and the game continues until either time is up or one team surrenders.

Planetball teams have huge followings, thousands of leagues and more than a million teams. The pinacle of the sport is backed by the Imperial Peers, has all-pervading merchandising and is talked about by people on every colony. At the other end of the sport, the bionics are less specialised, vehicles less reliable and fatalities common.

### Rail Fighting
Largely outlawed by local laws, Rail Fighting is a blood sport where people fight in a circular room with a rail 1.5m from the floor. The winner is the one to remain conscious and not touch the rail. Matches with fully bionic combatants can last an hour but the majority of fighters are mostly human. The trappings of gambling, match fixing, interstella fame and fraud are common. In the Tef Cluster (Dorian Sector), Full Blood rail fighting is played. The rail is switched off the first 5 minutes of the fight, hand weapons are commonly added to the room and death is common.
