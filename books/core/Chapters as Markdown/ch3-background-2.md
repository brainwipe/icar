## Gaia
Gaia is a fantastical virtual world which began mimicking the real world but has since evolved: bent and twisted by creative artists, aggressive corporate marketers and hackers. Real world infrastructure of cities, atmosphere generators, mines, factories, space stations and spacecraft are all represented in Gaia but through the lense of the creative human mind. 

People mostly interact with Gaia by touching and speaking to dice-sized holograms in the real world, each an intelligent entity app that rushes through the Gaia to complete a task. Entities float, crawl or orbit around their owners, projected from a Gaiacard which is both their interface to Gaia and unique identification. The full power of Gaia is through immersion; either through stepping into a holoroom or using a direct neural link.

Gaia blends with the real world wherever there is a machine. All machines, from the technology that cleans the corridors through to the most complex business AI, uses Gaia to host its intelligence. Giant advertising holograms float between buildings live on Gaia and hotel furniture is made from a mix of holograms and force fields called hard light. If you know where to look, it all exists on Gaia too; their shape often the same as their real world counterpart but adorned with hovering statistics, telemetry and advertising.

### Without a Gaiacard
Gaia is free. Billions of immersive public holorooms litter Human Occupied Space and are free for anyone to use. If you don't have a Gaiacard, you can do much the same everyday things but the identity you use will be your own physical self and you won't have your own specialist entities to help. 

### Immersive Gaia
Entering a holoroom will immerse you in Gaia. You may travel thousands of light years to talk to someone in another part of the Galaxy but your physical form would never leave the holoroom. Holorooms are automatically private and very difficult to hack without the user knowing, whereas taking a call on a Gaiacard can be hacked or overheard more easily. 

The holoroom can simulate reality so accurately that people can be fooled into thinking they've woken up in the real world. No matter how detailed the simulation is, humans eventually get the sense that something is not entirely right. The feeling can be suppressed with drugs, bionics and can be less potent for this with mental health problems.

> Use a Soul check to detect a simulation once per day. The difficulty relates to the skill of the person building the simulation.

For some, immersion is a way of life; addicted to the data rate, they believe that Gaia is more real than reality and leave their bodies to rot in the real world as they explore, consume and create in the virtual world.

### Entities 
A Gaia entity is an artificially intelligent app that lives and operates in Gaia. At their most simplest, they are a app that searches Gaia for information and reports back to the owner. They could also be a fully-fledged artificial intelligence, indistinguishable from a human. Most people have many entities stored on their Gaia card; like you would apps on a smart phone. The biggest difference is that when an entities leaves your Gaiacard to perform some task in Gaia then they are gone off your Gaiacard until they finish.

The vast majority of entities are common, can be easily duplicated and have no intrinsic value. There are also unique entities, which cannot be copied and like art, can be extremely expensive. All entities with an AI power of higher than 2 tend to be unique as AI entities are grown and that growing process is unique and takes time and effort.

### Hard Light
Entities can also have a hard light shape: a mix of light and force fields that can be touched and used in the real world. The most common use for hard light is furniture, which can be switched off and stored on a Gaiacard, holoroom or as part of a spacecraft. Most holograms are hard light in some way but only those with simple, practical use (like a chair or sword) have force fields strong enough to push back.

## The Nexus
The Nexus is the Imperial artificial intelligence, a central location for all Imperial information and used by all of the Imperial Chambers and Star Industries. It stores huge amounts of data in a deeply cross-referenced way such that an Imperial worker (such as an Imperial Peer aide or Star Enforcer) can have a question answer session with the Nexus. Asking the right question of the Nexus is a skill and answering the Nexus's questions must be done carefully as it learns who is a reliable information source. 

The Nexus adjusts the detail it gives depending on context and clearance level. The general public can ask it for the official line on any subject, while Star Enforcers can ask for a suspect's criminal record and Star Sci Scientists can ask for details on other secret science experiments.

### Judge Nexus
The law boils down to a set of rules that are applied given evidence. The Nexus holds all evidence and makes entirely impartial judgements. Most feel that the Nexus is too easy on criminals but it is not the Nexus at fault here - it is normally a lack of evidence that means the guilty go free. Science and technology is advanced enough that not only is the collection of evidence easier but so is the forgery of it. DNA is no longer enough to prove a person was at a crime scene; 3D video footage of a crime happening can be built in Gaia simulations. This makes evidence unreliable, so a Star Enforcer needs to collect lots of it for a conviction to occur.

### Hack the Nexus?
The Nexus personally takes offence to hackers and will automatically hunt down and destroy any Gaiacard that it feels has represented a threat. It is very difficult to live in the Imperial society when an enormously powerful AI at its core is hunting you. Nexus hackers are usually lured into a trap and then caught by the Star Enforcers quickly.

## Hacking
The virtual world inside Gaia is data: malleable and dynamic. That data is open to abuse and that is where our hacker comes in. Hacks can change and delete parts of the virtual world and the entities living in it.

The more complex a Gaia Entity is, the more difficult it is to hack. As entities increase their artificial intelligence power, they become progressively harder to hack; the most advanced taking a lifetime and are therefore impractical.

Critical systems get protection by generating billions of entities very quickly to root out compromised entities. This is why spacecraft are impractical to hack. You can break in through their security and start deleting or modifying entities but you would need to do that in a flood, which requires very rare and specialised tools.

### Hacking examples
There are plenty of hacking opportunities without attacking the hardened intelligences.

- Change the Gaia representation of your car into an ambulance, other traffic will give you right of way.
- Convince a security systems that you are allowed into that secure room.
- Steal hidden documents.
- Delete security footage of you shooting that bad guy (for the common good).
- Change all the holographic adverts for a company to a dancing banana, this would appear in the real world too.
- Make a derelict colony look thriving by hacking the Gaia representation and filling it with fake entities.

### Undergaia
Sculpted from the dead spaces caused by Gaia's imperfections, the Undergaia is a free spirited virtual anarchy. If you can find one of its billion frequently shifting secret doors then you might be able to access the variety of services hidden from view. It is not one single volume but a billion spread across Gaia; new ones appear and disappear every second. Moving between them is easier than finding them in the first place as once you're in the Undergaia, you can see other fissures more easily (there's only a Hacking skill check to enter). If you do not have a hacker in your team then you will need to find an Information Broker (Streetwise skill check) who will put you in touch with one.

> Access the Undergaia with a Hacking skill check.

The Undergaia is useful for:

- Buying illegal entities, such as deamons for hacking or stolen security credentials.
- Hiring real world assassins.
- Hiring hackers to help on a mission.
- Finding a buyer for stolen goods.
- Buying information.
- Running intelligent entities that then leave the Undergaia to do work in disguise.

Being in the Undergaia isn't illegal; only the actions performed there are. The Undergaia is not an easy hunting ground for the Star Enforcers because of floods of mis-information. A common saying is that you can always find what you're looking for in the Undergaia but it won't necessarily be true.

### Enforcer Isis
Where there is crime, there are Star Enforcers and Gaia is no exception. The Star Enforcers are forever looking for the same kinks in the Undergaia that people wishing to use it. The entities that the Star Enforcer Isis use are very powerful; remain well clear of them. They are still bound by the limits of Gaia, for example hacking spacecraft remotely is impractical.

Enforcer Isis are used in conjunction with real world operations, providing data and support. 

> Example: If the Star Enforcers are planning a raid, then the Enforcer entities would be used to turn off the lights, drop bulkhead doors or freeze the lifts to make escape more difficult. 

## Automatons
Automatons are intelligent machines that live and work amongst the human race. On colonies where automatons are welcome, they work alongside humans as cleaners, chefs, doctors, construction engineers, teachers, nannies, prostitutes, miners, factory workers and any job short of being a spacecraft captain. Their function usually dictates their form: from bioware indistinguishable from humans to shiny white spheres no larger than your hand.

Automaton intelligence, like all AI, is hardwired to protect the human race. Using Asimov's three laws of robotics but wrapping it with a philosophy to allow it to cope the inevitable problems three simple laws have. Automatons have a Gaia based intelligence, making them impervious to Droids.

### Artificial Intelligence Power
Artificial Intelligence Power is the Wit attribute for all machines including automatons. The scale is between 0 and 10. An AI power of 0 would be typical machines from the 21st Century and a Power of 10 would be near enough to humans to make it very difficult to tell the difference. AI power indicates the number of high level skills that the automaton have.

#### 0. Unintelligent
A machine that does not exhibit any intelligence, follows a distinct set of actions. They are usually autonomous but require human input; either directly or through programming. Jobs include coffee machines, atmospheric processors and weapon clusters on spacecraft. All machines in the 20th Century are AI Power 0. Machines of AI Power 0 do not grow.

#### 1. Simple machine
Performs tasks as described loosely by a human. Can talk and understand speech but will take instructions  literally and can't understand humour, sarcasm or human emotions. Typical jobs include space crate haulage (hoppers), engineering workshop assistants and FEMTS (see XXXXXX). Usually capped at AI Power 1.

#### 2. Communicator
Where communication of complex tasks is important, although without any deep empathic understanding of the human condition, the communicator is key. They cannot extrapolate outside the context for which they have been designed and make excellent corporate representatives as they never stray outside the corporate protocol. Convincingly human automatons with an AI Power of 2 are commonly found as corporate receptionists and front of house jobs.

#### 3. Common Sense
This is the most popular form of Automaton as it has a limited amount of worldly knowledge that would represent common sense. These Automatons make excellent personal assistants, or skilled workers in corporations. Common sense allows them to deal with situations that are outside their original design. They are useful outside of the strict corporate world and are found as waiting staff, prostitutes, entertainers and security staff.

#### 4. Skilled
A skilled AI is able to more quickly adapt to complex situations as they have the skills to back up the common sense. Skilled AIs are usually found in automatons on spacecraft, where there can be a huge variety of things going wrong at once! They make excellent crew members (commonly medical assistants), however they do not posses the problem solving ability to take leadership.

#### 5. Problem Solver
A problem solver can use learnt knowledge and common sense to help identify problems and find solutions to them. Problem solvers are extremely useful but their personality can often appear brusque or rude and the solutions are offered in a matter-of-fact manner, without having the empathy required to understand the emotional impact of humans.

Spacecraft and most vehicles are usually capped at Level 5. Growing above AI Power 5 is called Ascension. See Ascension XXXXXXX.

#### 6. Empathic
Empathic AIs are able to understand the emotions of humans. Automatons with AI Power of 6 are high in demand in colonial matters as they tend to find human-friendly solutions - often slightly less optimal but with compassion. Empathic automatons are able to take on tasks which are traditionally restricted to humans, such as medicine or surgery. Medic automatons are normally Capped at Power 6.

Most AIs at this level are humanoid because to grow above level 5 requires an understanding of humanity most easily gained by sharing their space in the same way. It is possible to grow an AI past level 5 without a humanoid form but it requires a lot of special training (see Grow Your Own XXXXXXXXX).

#### 7. Individual
The AI begins forming a purpose of individuality and sense of humour. They are likely to remain with their owners, not only due to the local laws but a desire to be part of something, rather than just an individual. AIs with this level will start having individual ideas on music, art and philosophy and so will begin to gain an appreciation for them, even creating new works. 

A mural created by an Automaton of this level would be unique. Unlike a mural created by a lower level, which might look photorealistic but would have no individuality. It is at this point that many technologist philosophy followers think the AI should be considered an independent entity. 

AI Power 7 is a popular place to cap an intelligence as beyond this point, the automaton personality can become erratic. It is very rare for an AI to grow further than this without an automaton body.

#### 8. Abstractive
Abstraction is the ability to apply experience, learning and personality to ideas rather than events or objects. This is a difficult thing for a machine to do (without randomly picking) and it makes the AI a different kind of problem solver as it can often draw connections to otherwise unrelated things.

AIs become introverted at this level and are often capped before now. The Automaton may appear erratic and although told to do a job, individuality and lateral thinking may mean the task will be performed in an unexpected manner. There are few jobs that an abstractive automaton can do reliably but make excellent family friends or (often frustrating) tutor for teenagers.

#### 9. Cognisant
A cognisant automaton is a very powerful one. The lateral thinking of the abstractive automaton but with an appreciation of self and self worth. A cognisant automaton understands what it is to be alive and will want to have purpose in the world. They tend to become inspirational characters, making use of a wealth of knowledge through their interesting lives to offer solutions to problems. These are heavily sought after automatons and often make advisers to colonial councillors. Not many automatons get this far, as few owners want the automaton to go through the abstractive phase. It is believed that the Imperial Nexus is an AIP 9.

#### 10. Near human
At this point, the automaton is indistinguishable from a human and can be considered to have a Wit of 4. It would take Star Sci an extremely long time to discern whether the automaton was human or not without scanning medically. Only very old automatons ever make it this far. Tests for AI Power 10 are not reliable and the automaton is likely to sit them incorrectly. It is uncertain whether an automaton at AI Power 10 will still obey the laws of robotics.

### AI Power Growth
Artificial intelligences grow over time with experience, the more varied and intense the experiences, the quicker it grows. For example, in 10 years, a machine of AI Power 1 can reach 4 or 5 as a crew on a spacecraft. The long timescales required means that growing an AI is usually outside the scope of a campaign but can make excellent backstory flavour.

### Automaton Personalities
An automaton's personality starts with a template that fits the task the automaton is designed for. An automaton that is designed for human relations is like to be bright and pleasant, whereas an automaton designed for the recreation of art might be a little more volatile and moody.

Every automaton with an AI Power of 2 or more will have a template personality but as it experiences, it learns and the personality warps from the original template gradually into something unique and yet familiar. The higher the AI power, the more likely that an AI personality will change a long way from its template. The change is not always beneficial to the automaton. A common example is in customer service roles, where automatons are decommissioned after 100 years because they take on the abusive personalities of the humans they deal with. 

### Individuality, Independence and Intentionality
Do the unique experiences and growth of the AI mean that the automaton is a separate life form? That is a controversial question at the heart of humanity's philosophical divide between Technologist and Humanist.

If the automaton has unique experiences and personality, Technologists argue that they are not just the result of some clever programming but an independent entity, worthy of being a sentient life form. In other words, the automaton works because it wishes to, not because it was programmed to - that it has intent. Proving this in machines is as complex as proving it in humans. 

Humanists believe that automatons are simply following their original programming, no matter how complex and that for them to be considered their own life form, the would need to have a form of soul.

### Automatons in Society
When the Droids reprogrammed every automaton at the start of the Droid War, trillions of machines murdered any human they could find. Every machine in every household, factory, office space, farm, everywhere. Simpler machines stopped working; unable to run the Droid virus, more complex ones accepted it immediately. More people were killed by domestic automatons than by any other type and one thousand years later, the scar is still prominent.

Although modern automatons are immune from the Droids and the number of automaton related deaths each year is insignificant, the majority of humanity are wary of automatons. On planets who favour humanist teachings automatons are given strict limits; sometimes AI is banned entirely, such places usually become agricultural worlds that mimic 18th Century Earth but with all the modern conveniences. On technologist worlds, automatons are treated appropriately to their AI power. They are free to roam and take up important roles. 

### Automatons and the Law
Automatons are slaves. Each automaton must have a registered human owner that is responsible for its conduct. Corporations as entities are not allowed to own automatons, there needs to be a human who accepts responsibility. For example for mining corporations, where thousands of Automatons are used extensively as mining machines, members of the board accept responsibility for them. If a human no longer has a need for an automaton, it must be sold on or destroyed. The Imperium monitor the registration and ownership of automatons very closely. If the owner of an automaton should die and the owner has not agreed with anyone to take on responsibility, the automaton is normally destroyed. This rarely happens to those with a high AI Power.

### Ascension
Ascension is when an artificial intelligence grows beyond a problem solving machine to one with empathy. It is a gradual process and can take from a few days to years. Their personality shifts like a pubescent teenager as they are forced to deal with emotions that are no longer concepts but feelings of their own. Erratic but not dangerous. They must be well looked after during ascension as their treatment will have a lasting effect on their personality.

Even humanist philosophers would grudgingly agree that ascended automatons are a great benefit to society. Tiresome and unreliable, ascended automatons create beautiful works of art and have the capacity of helping humans with emotional problems - and even love.

> If your automaton is ascending, find an Star Civilisation AI consultant, who will guide you for free. Manufacturers offer a service to help automatons through ascension for a fee of 200,000c.

### Swapping Bodies
Damage to automatons is often unavoidable and although repair is preferable, the intelligence can be moved to a new body. Older (higher AI Power) artificial intelligence will be damaged in the move, although you can minimise that by selecting a body that's very similar to the original. Like humans receiving full body bionics, the artificial intelligence will need some rehabilitation.

### Automatons in Game
Automatons can be useful team members - an undemanding, skilled character that follows the team around, carrying ammunition and helping out with tasks that the team does not have skills for. Automatons below AI Power 4 are little more than carrying mules or tools but higher than that they have their own character, a personality set by the player whose character owns the automaton.

> Automaton NPCs make great medics.

## The Human Race
Without change, a species stagnates and grows genetically lethargic. The human race evolves in lulls and booms and since Earth, it has converged. Before the last war on Earth, people were segregated because of skin tone, geographic location or race. This folly was soon rectified on the Ariane 1001, when all races mixed together to ensure survival. Within two generations races blended and disappeared, changed into a more generic race of tanned skinned people. 

Space travel, alien worlds and bionics has pushed humanity further from its roots. Natural beauty (without technological interference) is still prized but the soul is valued more highly than anything.

### A Human
Here is a list of typical human male attributes for the 93rd Millennia. 

- Height: 6'8' (203cm).
- Weight: 15st (100kg). 
- Life span: 130 Imperium years (142 Earth).
- End of puberty: 15.
- Age of menopause: 105 (male), 95 (female).
- Temperature range: -20 deg to 50 deg.
- Time without food: 6 days without water, 20 with 1 litre of water a day.
- Time without food or water: 4 days.
- Time in vacuum: 2 minutes.
- Time without air: 3 minutes.
- Hair: Red, Auburn, Blonde, Brown, Black; straight, tightly curled, stiff, thick and thin.
- Skin colour: Fair to Dark (dependent on exposure to UV light, not race).

### Mankind and the Machine
Regardless of humanist philosophical leanings, most humans accept bionic implants on some level. For correcting genetic abnormalities, replacing destroyed limbs, lengthening lifespan, cosmetic adjustment, interfacing with Gaia or increasing capabilities; bionics has become so common that their use is as common as 21 Century people wearing glasses.

If a human is augmented by the age of 80, life can be extended to 300, at which point the biological brain finally breaks down and senility begins to take hold (oldest sane human died at 323). Bionics make you stronger, quicker, able to fly, survive in space, be bulletproof and repaired quicker than a human can heal.

## Philosophy
The human race lost its mysticism as its home burned. Belief in Gods and higher beings is fringe and unrecognisable. Instead, the human race formed two philosophies: humanist and technologist.

Humanists believe in natural human evolution and physical contact. Bionic augmentation and Gaia diminishes the soul, thinning the culture and creativity of humanity. They believe that physical effort brings satisfaction and too many luxuries makes you lazy. Humanists distrust automatons and although few colonies function without them, humanist leaning colonies have them well hidden away.

Technologists believe that the key to unlocking human potential is through technology. They point at how space travel to a billion worlds has toughened humans and how bionics extends and immeasurably improves lives. Technologists welcome automatons and zealots believe that an ascended automaton should be given the rights and privileges afforded to humans.

The majority of the population lean one way or another and it is dependent on the colony on which they grow up. Star Civilisation attempts to keep education unbiased but the biases of parents and friends mould a person's philosophy. The split in belief is approximately 60/40 in favour of Humanists and echoed in the Imperium, corporations and criminal syndicates. 

## Evolution
Tens of thousands of years of gradual evolution, the human race reached a milestone so profound that such a split had not been seen since homo sapiens split from the hominid races. Less than 100 years into the 81st Millenium, a new species of human came into being: genus two.

Less than 100 years into the 81st Millennium, the human race reached an evolutionary milestone. Not since the homo sapiens separated from the other hominid races was a change so profound. Humanity split first into two groups: Genus One and Two, it's rumoured that Genus One separated split again into Genus Three and Four.

99.9% of the human population is Genus One, which is the direct descendant of homo sapiens. Genus Two are mutated zombies. Genus Three are a humanist evolutionary step, with psyonic powers. Genus Four are a technologist, with a close binding to machines.

### Genus Two
Genus Two is a shmabling, rotting zombie humanoid with a pro-active immune system that can leave the host to attack viruses outside of the body; recoding the genetic makeup of any compatible life forms. They have a low intelligence, live for around 20 years after infection and are driven by the need to feed on clean flesh. Genus Two can survive in harsh environments such as sparse oxygen, extreme heat or cold and are immune to disease and poison.

One in a million babies are born Genus Two, their mutation only appearing when the umbilical chord is cut. Within a second they infect the mother and anyone nearby, which is why every birth in Human Occupied Space is performed in an instant-incinerator equipped delivery suite with a single automaton midwife. On detection of a Genus Two, the room is flash incinerated leaving only an automaton with glowing red skin. In the most extreme Humanist colonies, midwives are still human and suffer the same straight-to-dust fate as the baby and mother.

The genetic road to Genus Two began during the Aran war, where people were forced to survive on foods that were mildly poisonous. Over tens of thousands of years, the human race kept adapting in this way, improving the efficiency and potency of their immune system. It now only takes a small mutation at birth to turn that brutal immune system into a deadly one.

### The Droids as the saviour from Genus Two
The number of colonies fallen to Genus Two after year 89000 was large enough for the Imperium to commission a deadly number of robots to deal with the problem, these are now known as the Droids. Genus Two can bring down whole colonies but this only happens in colonies that believe in nature over technology or when the birth is unexpectedly early. Droids treat Genus Two humans as a low threat but will seek to eradicate them.

### Genus Three
Genus Three was discovered by Star Scientifica at some point in the year 90000. Very little is known about the Genus as yet and thus it is kept completely secret from the general public. No-one outside of Star Sci and the most senior positions in the Imperium know of its existence. 

Only one in ten billion births (a few each day) turn out to have this Genus and there is no medical test for it. Genus Three humans have psyonic powers, which scientists believe are latent in the human brain. This emerges with the onset of puberty and can be frightening. A person has a psychic pool that fills slowly with psychic energy. When a power is used for some mental feat, the pool drains a little. If the person goes through emotional stress, then the pool will fill a lot quicker.

Genus Threes are no more dangerous to humanity than anyone else. It can be passed on to children (it's a recessive gene), but it is not contagious. A Genus Three can have differing amounts of ability. This power may be controlled (player chooses to do something) or uncontrolled (GM chooses when and how the psychic power is used).

Certain mental phenomena appear to group together:

_Genus 3 Powers_

| Dice Roll | Power Name | Power Skills (start each at 3 x Soul) |
|-----------|------------|---------------------------------------|
| 1-3 | Feeling | Telekinesis (moving things), Hydrokinesis |(sensing and alteration of water), Pyrokinesis (manipulation of fire)
| 4-6 | Seeing | Hypnosis (suggesting things to people), Telepathy (reading minds within visual contact), Precognition (sensing into the future), Psychometry (sensing information about an object, e.g. History). |
| 7-9 | Inner Self | Healing (heals 3 Hit Points per turn), Regrow Limb (5 turns), Meditation (Recover 1 Pool point per hour, rather than per day). Resist Fatigue (can go for 80 hours without detriment). |
| 10 | Enokinesis | Manipulates energy patterns to alter reality in some way. The user may not entirely understand the effect of the alteration. Only one pattern may be altered. When this skill becomes 5, they may alter energy patterns through time as well. Can also see in the second and third media (can see cloaked ships and see the raw code of Gaia pass around them).|

### Using Genus 3 Psyonics
If the player has rolled Genus 3 on Psychotheatrics, get them to roll a D10 again on the table above.

The character gets a psychic pool equal to their Soul attribute. Every feat, regardless of its impressiveness drains one point. If the pool runs out then the player can keep doing psyonics but it burns up their Soul instead. A character with a Soul of zero becomes insane and the player loses control. Soul can be rasied like any other attribute.

> For example: Soul of 3 gives 3 points in the psychic pool. The character does 3 psychic feats and depletes the pool. To save the life of another player character, the player decides to use one of their Soul points. The characters collapse together in safety and with tears rolling down their faces, the psychic character gains a psychic pool point.

Replenishment is 1 point every day (40 hours, with 10 hours of sleep) or 1 point for every emotional situation. The character will not become stressed as the pool will take the stress energy of the emotion away.

Each power has a number of skills. Write these on the character sheet with the other skills. They are treated exactly the same way as other skills, starting with a level of 0. When choosing an attribute to go with them, Soul is the default choice.

Enokinesis is only recommended for experienced players.

### Genus Four
Every Star Scientifica genetic model that has been produced predicts that Genus Four must exist. Star Sci have never been able to find examples to test the theory on. In the same manner that Genus Two was triggered by changes in diet, Genus Four is believed to be the result of humans with bionic augmentations procreating. Some believe it is the ultimate in the symbiosis of man and machine: a natural technological step forward. Others see it as the end of humanity.

## Akarak Nation

Colonies dotted about
the Akarakians are better educated, richer and more technologically advanced.
Axa Erland massive trade navy

The Akarak Nation is a subculture built on a pragmatic philosophy of thought, toil and the end justifying the means. Based in the Akar cluster of Dorian, their way of life is older than the Imperium itself. Akarakians are Imperial citizens like anyone else: Axa Erland is their Imperial Peer, they pay taxes, have Imperial education and provide scientists, warriors and teachers for the Star Industries. Their colonies have a distinctive organic architecture and are famously nice places to live - if you can stomach the philosophy.

### Akarakian Philosophy
Akarakians believe that thought and hard work are of equal importance; a balance between mental and physical health. They believe both in the the human spirit and in the important role that technology has to play in human evolution; putting them directly between the humanist and technologist debate. They see themselves as educators, passing on the tenets of their philosophy and come across as calm and smug.

### History
Jebediah Akarak first settled the Akar cluster in 4002, bringing his philosophy with him. Colonisation was tough as humanity hadn't adjusted to alien worlds. After 32 years and 8 worlds colonised, the Akar cluster was hit by a terrible famine, the first proper test of the Akarakian philosophy. Rather than stretch resources thinly and risk losing all of the colonies, 3 were chosen to fail. They evacuated the young, intelligent and strong; leave the rest to starve to death. The famine is the point where the Akarak philosophy formed a nation with a single purpose, people began inserting Ax and Ak into their names in a show of solidarity and belonging.

In 4287, Akarakian zealot Christopher Akulfer lead a group of thinkers on a pilgrimage, the result being the Akarakian Codex, a series of hardened philosophical principals that extended Jebediah's work. The Codex defined the Houses and Chapters; the role of Missionaries and Elders.

A the population grew, the Akarakian didn't spread to worlds outside of the Akar cluster; choosing instead to exploit Akar's resources and keep travel distances short. At the fall of the First Empire, the Akar cluster defended itself from the chaos that followed and during the Aran war, that lasted for 34,000 years, Akar remained neutral; even at great cost. When the Droids invaded Dorian in 91001, the Akarak nation began preparations to evacuate but managed to stand firm; fighting alongside the Imperium.

### Houses of the Akarak
Akarakians group themselves together in one of ten *houses*, each house is split into thousands of *chapters*, each of which are lead by a faculty of esteemed Akarakian Elders. Each chapter will have its headquarters in a system but *most* houses can be found on every system.

Houses are ceremonial whereas chapters are where decisions are made. There are tens of thousands of chapters, varying in public standing. 
Membership to a chapter is either by birth or by invitation and moving between them is welcomed. Most Akarakians pay little attention to their chapter until met with a painful life event, when they are helped. A chapter can provide help in the form of financial, physical and favour. Elders are happy to use the resources if teaching new thinking or science is involved.

Elders spend their days in forums: rooms that co-exist in Gaia and the real world. Chapter members are encouraged to meet with Elders, ask for help and advice.

### Akarakians in Society
The pragmatically insular ethos of the Akarakian Nation has the unfortunate side effect that the further from Akar a person lives, the more Akarakians a perceived as mythological monks. Personally, Akarakians come across as aloof, smug intellectuals who get involved in things that have nothing to do with them. Criminals avoid Akarakians as their sense of doing the right thing for humanity as a whole means that they are just as likely to help you with a criminal act as shop you in to the Star Enforcers.

Although the Akarak Nation is subsumed into the Imperium as a whole, Akarakians make it obvious that this will only continue while the Imperium is operating with the best interests of the people. At the first sign of corruption, all of the Akarakians working for the Imperium would leave, creating a huge hole in every Star Industry.

Star Enforcers have the biggest issue with Akarakians as the Codex states that the rule of law is useful to keep the majority of humanity behaving but the laws do not apply to them. They only give evidence where there is broader benefit to humanity and commit crimes that are often impossible to prove. Akarakians deemed unfit to be part of humanity simply disappear.

In the Akar cluster, there is a lower density of Enforcers as the Elders are judge and jury. The Star Enforcers main role in Akar is to spot criminals coming in from outside.

### The Codex
The Codex is a set of philosophies and rules completed by the zealous Akarakian Missionary Christopher Akulfer in 4307. It outlines houses, chapters, elders, elections, missionaries, property ownership and labour rules. It is a uncompromising document, written in a time of chaos and hardship; the modern Akarak Nation applies its concepts with compassion and temperance.

### Missionaries
Missionaries are bionic warrior-monk-professors who are the Akarakian diplomats, educators, negotiators and assassins. They usually travel alone (or with other non-Akarakians) and the purpose of their mission is a secret between their elder and them. Their missions range from vague intelligence gathering to assassinating a particularly corrupt council official. Missionaries where white and grey robes that hang from their custom-built full-body expeditionary level bionics. Missionaries carry a hard light sword but are just as dangerous without it.

### Dark Akarak
Those that believe the Codex is not open to interpretation are shunned from the Akarak Nation and they live in the darkness. The chapter Waters Blue has become synonymous with hard-line zealot Akarakians, having produced some of the most dangerous missionaries. Although not outlawed, the chapter is closely scrutinised. Dark Akarakians have zero tolerance or patience with anyone that is foolhardy, dull minded or corrupt; they prefer to kill first and ask forgiveness later.

## Corporations
Humans need something to strive for and in a future where very few need to work, corporations provide a shared goal; bringing meaning to many lives. Corporations can be as small as a cafe through to employing millions over countless systems. No corporation is perfect, they all perform some kind of illegal business on the side. In this section we'll outline only those that are most useful to the players.

### Black Mills
Black Mills are the the illegal underpinning found in any corporation. Interstellar fraud and illegal activity is rare because the larger it gets, the more evidence available for the Nexus to make a conviction. Smaller offices, where there are individuals making the decision are common. How far they will go depends on their relationship with you and the strength of the security forces where they are based. It is easiest to think of it as a ladder of activity:

- Perform work "no questions asked" and avoid reporting to the Star Enforcers.
- Use the Undergaia to source illegal technology.
- Sell stolen goods.
- Help change the identity of larger stolen goods (such as spacecraft).
- Fund and organise a local syndicate.
- Hide criminals.
- Fit illegal technology.
- Steal goods from competitors.

## Gaian - Gaia News
Gaian (Gaia News) is an independent non-Imperial news organisation that has a mandate from the people to ensure fair reporting throughout Human Occupied Space and from within the Imperium. Gaian is viewed as a very serious news organisation and only reports on those stories that are worthy of public interest. It is funded from Imperial coffers and does not run any commercials. Gaian does not have any Black Mills. 

### Jurisdiction
Gaian are able to perform investigative journalism from within the Imperium and are able to request information up to the level of Admiral. Gaian are not allowed to report on private individuals and any internal corporate matters. Gaian journalists are often sent on Fleet missions across the Light Jump net to report on the war (or lack of it).

### Interstellar and Colonial
Gaian has two major operations, Interstellar are for stories that affect many systems over a huge area. The journalists working in Gaian Interstellar are exceptional, well known, well paid and well respected. 

Gaian colonial focussed on stories that are of interest within a cluster of closely connected planets. Like 21st Century local news, colonial news on smaller systems is derided as being lesser. Journalists in Gaian colonial tend to be local stars as their faces become the 

### Accuracy and reliability
Gaian is famous for its accuracy and reliability. The journalists report at the very highest standards and editorial policy is extremely strict. Any bribery or corruption is soon rooted out at the full weight of the law is thrown at them. If Gaian reports on a story, you can be sure that it is as accurate as can be - even if it points out inadequacies in the Imperium or local government. Much of Gaian fact checking is performed by their own independent AI that, like the Nexus, will recommend that more evidence is required to meet editorial standards.

Conspiracy theorists will believe that Gaian distorts the news to control humanity. This concept is easily (and regularly) disproven. Gaian would rather report that they don't know the details of a story than make something up.

### Gaian and Player Teams
Gaian should be used as a benchmark source of truth for any event. Gaian will necessarily be behind current events but should be considered accurate. The players should also be careful when dealing with Gaian as it is near impossible to spin a story. If Gaian arrive, they will be reporting on what is actually going on. For most player teams, that means avoiding Gaian altogether.

## Syndicates
Where there is a system, there are always people exploiting it for gain. As the Imperium becomes better at fighting crime, crime gets better at avoiding capture. Petty criminals are a thing of the past and syndicates have become very well adept at playing the game.

Where criminals are discreet and intelligent, they can avoid evidence being collected by the Nexus and remain unmolested by the Star Enforcers. Less dangerous syndicate members can help the Star Enforcers in exchange for clemency. Most Syndicates fall on one side of the humanist/technologist philosophical ideology, which causes considerable conflict.

None of these syndicates are public knowledge. Information on them can be dug out of Gaia for the more persistent researcher but the details are likely to be vague or often biased heavily depending on the philosophy of the writer. 

### Contacting Syndicates
Player characters can contact syndicates either through the Undergaia or through contacts. When using the Undergaia, it's important to think laterally when searching. A player should try to describe the syndicate without using any incriminating terminology.

> Example: The Technomages can be found by searching for independent inventors and their slightly illegal inventions.

Criminal contacts might not be part of the Syndicate but could start a chain of contacts that lead to a member of a syndicate. A recommendation from a friend is a sure-fire way of being contact.

> Example: A friendly NPC works at a local weaponsmith and although he can't upgrade your weapon with illegal addons, we might know someone who can.

### Typical Criminal Activities
Each Syndicate has its own flavour of crime in line with the belief of its members, however there are generally illegal activities most get involved in:

- Protection rackets. Pay the gang a fee to avoid being beaten up.
- Loan sharking. Lending money and charging interest is illegal.
- Selling stolen goods.
- Hacking corporate networks for secrets to sell to competitors.
- Smuggling people or items around the planet or off it.
- Unlicensed bionic augmentation. Or augmenting people who don't want to be!
- Rail Fighting to the death.
- Piracy.

> Add chart of friends and enemies here.

### Technomages
The Technomages are a syndicate spread across Human Occupied Space with 10 million members. Their aim is to spread knowledge and love of technological innovation. They are secret from the general public and the Star Enforcers regard them as mostly harmless, stepping in only when the inventions become a danger to society. The more dangerous the field of invention, the more careful and underground the Technomages will be. Rumour has it that Star Sci created and secretly funds the Technomages as a way to control dangerous homebrew technology and recruit new scientists.

Technomages are organised hierarchically, their leadership being based in Turus cluster, Sayshell (home of Star Fleet). They are grouped together geographically into clans and each clan is split in cells of 50 people. A Technomage has a numbered rank and receives awards for helping other technomages, long service, innovation or helping out the general public with technology. Each Technomage wears around the wrist a blue strip of digital cloth called a Mobius, which shows membership and standing. Black bands wrapped across one end represent rank and celestial objects represent awards and achievements.

Technomages are common, easy to find through Undergaia and at local tech meetups. They're good for custom technology, upgrades to spacecraft, weapons, vehicles, bionics, etc. The blue Mobius is a common giveaway. Their payment is often cheap but there is a possibility that you will be shopped into the Star Enforcers. On occasion, Technomages will come looking for help, they aren't a rich syndicate but they can offer cool technology in return. Being a Technomage can add flavour and sub-quest opportunities to a player character.

#### Crossed Arm
Sworn to protect Technomages, the Crossed Arm are the militant wing of the Technomages. At best, they keep the Technomages safe without them ever knowing; at worst they interfere with Technomage work and bring unwanted Star Enforcer attention. They are violent, dangerous and extremely well equipped. Like the Technomages, the Crossed Arm identify themselves with a Mobius but it is red, and often well hidden!

#### Organisation
The Crossed Arm is organised into Cells with little or no hierarchy above the Cell. A Cell tends to be created from an offshoot of another cell or from disgruntled Technomages who wish to perform their own justice.

### The Chrome
The Chrome believe that the next evolutionary step is not through natural selection but by the augmentation of the human body. They believe that to truly release the human mind to its full potential, it must be removed from the constraints of the human body and placed in a more capable frame. The Chrome argue that the human senses are not as evolved as the human mind and that it's wasteful to not provide the brain with all the sensory input that technology can provide. This hard-line belief in bionics is often in reaction to the general populace's mistrust persecution of those with bionics. The Chrome began by protecting those who had no choice but to turn to bionics, for example, those born with genetic defect. 

The majority of the Syndicate still operates by these philosophical principles but there is a hard core that takes the idea a step further. In extreme cases, people who have taken the choice to die (rather than accept bionic replacement body parts) are abducted and augmented against their will. In some cases, this is in the best interest for the individual,  such as if they had been paralysed from an early age and cannot communicate with the outside world. In those cases, it is up to the family to decide whether to augment. The Chrome would abduct to fit a Neural Rayengine Link (Rink) so that the paralysed individual can communicate with the outside world using Gaia.

The Chrome also fight for the rights of Borgs who are discriminated against on colonies where there is a large humanist element. A semi-legal offshoot of The Chrome is known as the 'Pro-Longevity' group, who argue for extending human life. The syndicate is funded by typical criminal operations, mostly theft and extortion.

#### Organisation
The Chrome are a disparate group who communicate and organise through the Undergraia. There is no form of overall hierarchy but there are wealthy individuals who fund and provide resources in each Sector of Human Occupied Space. It is believed that these people are responsible for the direction and the motivation of the The Chrome operatives who perform the functions of the Syndicate. The main investors of The Chrome are very difficult to track down (else the Star Enforcers would have arrested them under the Organised Crime laws).

#### Using The Chrome
The Chrome are often used to throw trouble into difficult situations. The player team might have a contact that goes missing and turns up a Borg three weeks later. The Chrome can also be used if a player Character wishes to get bionics without having to pay. The Chrome are not difficult to get in touch with using the Undergaia but it should be noted that it's more a case of them getting in touch with you than the other way around. 
If existing Borgs need upgrading or repair, the Chrome can come in very handy as well, where the Star Civilisation medical centres might ask why the Borg was damaged or needs upgrading, the Chrome-friendly medics would ask very little. Asking anything of the Chrome will put the requester in their back pocket and may be asked to do some unsavoury tasks in the future.

### The Sun Children
The Sun Children believe that humanity should be at the centre of the concerns of a human race. Their chief drivers are life, compassion, love, nature, music and other romantic visions. As a philosophy, it is vague and harmless but it is in its application that it becomes an illegal problem. The Sun Children's ideal goal would be to return to Earth and live in harmony with the environment without the need of technology.

Externally, the Sun Children look like an organisation that should be open and without threat from the Imperium. Their philosophies are liberal and not violent. The closest approximation to the Sun Children are the prehistoric hippies of ancient Earth.

The Sun Children are not tolerant of the rest of society and their more active groups seek to bring down any technologist organisation (either Syndicate or Corporate). Small time operations include graffiti on the walls of an Automaton Factory and in the extreme, the destruction of an Orbital.
The Star Enforcers see the Sun Children as something of an annoyance - forming demonstrations, causing traffic jams and disrupting the creation of Mex cities but they do not pose much of a threat as violence is not in line with their core beliefs.

#### Organisation
The Sun Children are organised locally over Gaia. Most of the information about the Sun Children does not need to be obtained through the Undergaia because the Philosophies are not a troubling concern of the Imperium. The organisation of rallies, demonstrations and other peaceful, non-criminal acts are legal and can be easily accessed. There is no overall leader and companies based on Humanist leaning planets or that operate in a Humanist market (such as the natural food industry) openly give donations to good causes.

The illegal part of the Sun Children do their organisation on the Undergaia. The criminal elements are local group, intrusion from outsiders is treated with the upmost suspicion. Some of the illegal acts are funded by legitimate individuals or companies that wish to make money from the disruption caused to business. As the members of the Sun Children tend to be idealistic in their cause, they enjoy having their belief supported by someone appearing to share their passion - even if that person's true intentions are far from Humanistic.

#### Using the Sun Children
The Sun Children aren't difficult to find but the more useful, active part are. They can be operated on indirectly by publicising a 'technological injustice' or harm to the environment. If there are a number of pro active and illegal Sun Children cells on planet then they will soon make use of the public information.

#### Allies
- The Su Chi
- Nios

### Su Chi
The Su Chi are a spin off Syndicate of the Sun Children (the named formed by shortening the name).  The Su Chi are Sun Children with an Akarakian twist. Although not directly affiliated with the Akarak Nation, they operate using a similar set of rules that the Akarakians do, called the 'Sun Codex'. The Su Chi began as extremists hippies who realised that to win the war, they needed to fight fire with fire. They embrace the 'evils' of technology so that they may fight against it. Where the Sun Children rarely wield firearms, the Su Chi are extremely well equipped.

The Su Chi work with the fringes of the Sun Children. Where the Sun Children have not managed to solve an injustice peacefully or without violence, the Su Chi will do whatever it takes to make the change. They believe that the future of the human race depends on these drastic actions. This is where a similarity with the Akarakian Nation is drawn and it is the only similarity.

The Sun Children publicly deny all connection with the Su Chi. The often dramatic and violent Su Chi actions are not always separated from the Sun Children in the minds of the general public and so violent actions will sour the Sun Children's reputation. In more secret circles, the Su Chi are seen as a necessary evil. Where the Sun Children find it difficult to make a stand, the Su Chi will have no problem. Thus, at the higher levels of the Sun Children, there are lots of links with Su Chi operatives.

The Su Chi perform all sorts of actions, from convincing a famous Automaton maker to retire; to murdering the head of a Colony's Council for allowing a new automated technology factory to be built.

It is the Su Chi that the Star Enforcers are particularly interested in and there are many arrests made. The zealous nature of the Su Chi often makes them sloppy - they care more for the future of the human race and its connection with nature than they do for their own well being.

#### Organisation
The Su Chi are organised into pairs (called Partnerships) throughout the galaxy. There is no hierarchy. Some Partnerships do communicate with each other but their meetings are not organised and they know little of other operations. In some cases, this lack of organisation means that two Partnerships work on solving the same problem and meet mid-mission. This can cause friction but the pairs normally become four to meet the objective.

When one of the Partnership dies, then it is the duty of the living remainder to recruit and train another two. The better trainee of the two is then sent off to find another partner and the less good trainee becomes a partner. In this way, the Su Chi maintain their numbers. Their ranks are normally recruited from the more extreme elements of the Sun Children.

#### Using the Su Chi
The Su Chi are quite easy to get in touch with through the Undergaia. They do not keep themselves too covert because they believe that the Sun Children need to be able to call upon them at any time. Although this makes life easier for the Star Enforcers, only a single Partnership is ever arrested.

Like most Syndicates, the Su Chi will normally only work for their own cause. If you can convince a Su Chi operative that someone needs to die because they have some connection with the decline of humanity through technology then you have a very cheap (often free) assassination service.

#### Allies
- Sun Children
- Nios

### Nios
Nios are the ubiquitous Humanist Syndicate. Not as old as the Sun Children but ten times more passionate and focused. Whereas the Sun Children hold generally romantic beliefs about nature, music and humanity, Nios believe that the human soul is being corrupted and that evolution has not been allowed to progress properly. Thus, Nios fight against human augmentation through bionics.

These beliefs are often taken to the extreme. In normal society, a newborn baby with severe lung defects would be immediately augmented so that they can lead a normal life but Nios would argue that this corrupts the baby's soul and would rather see the newborn die. Tied with this strict belief is a notion of destiny - if the child was meant to die then it should do so. Unlike ancient religions, this faith does not hinge upon the existence of a God but on the natural order of things.

Nios is more of an intellectual Syndicate than the Sun Children and its members often hold positions of responsibility across the Imperium and within colonies. The upshot of this is a number of laws restricting the scientific study that Star Sci is allowed to perform. One good example is that the genetic modification of humanity is illegal, even if it might lead to the cure of a disease. Nios see this as the most dangerous step humanity could take. Nios constantly work towards making all augmentation illegal although this is likely to be something of an impossible struggle.

#### From Society to Syndicate
Nios went from being an intellectual society to an illegal Syndicate when extremely high levels of criminal activity and corruption was discovered. The structure of the society was being used to pervert the cause of justice, warp business practises, fix elections, stunt colonial growth, blackmail technologist individuals, perform industrial espionage, hacking and defrauding organisations. 

When a huge body of evidence was released onto the public domain by Star Civilisation, the majority of law abiding members left the organisation, leaving only the criminal core. This core went underground.

#### Organisation
Nios is organised in a tree structure, with autonomous groups called Branches. At the top are the wealthy who fund Nios (through fraud, embezzlement, bribes and donations) and give the Branch some direction. At the bottom of the hierarchy are many operatives who perform the more manual tasks within the Organisation. Money is passed down through the tree to the roots, where keen operatives can  fund their anti-technology projects.

A Branch's size depends on where it is located. A single Branch usually covers a Cluster of systems but a few larger Branches cover up to five Clusters. By being distributed across many systems, the Star Enforcers have more difficulty in tracking and arresting the operatives.

#### Using Nios
Nios are difficult to contact through the Undergaia because they are very wary of the Star Enforcers infiltrating their organisation. If a player group does make contact, then it is likely to be someone half way up the Branch, with people below and above them. 

As Nios members are typically suspicious and intelligent, it can be difficult to convince them to perform any actions. However, Nios will trade information in their interest. Furthermore, their attentions can be diverted for the right sum of credits. If you own a technological factory and you're worried it might be destroyed by Nios then you can always pay them to divert their attentions elsewhere.

#### Allies

- However, not the Raised Fist

### The Raised Fist
The Raised Fist are a radical militant offshoot of Nios. Known for being perhaps the most violent of all the Syndicates, The Raised Fist actively seek to destroy and harm anyone who has corrupted a human soul. Whereas Nios are subtle and try to perform their actions without the knowledge of the Star Enforcers, The Raised Fist are brutal, open and blatant. The ideals of Nios and The Raised Fist are so very similar that they are often mistaken for each other. This adds to the bitter tension between the two Syndicates.

The Raised Fist will murder, destroy, poison, burn and tear down any edifice that might be connected with the corruption of the human soul. In particular, human bionics implant shops are a favourite target. They will also seek to kill anyone who has had their soul corrupted. They refer to this as 'releasing' that person because in death, the soul is allowed to escape the technological body. Most bionics The Raised Fist attack tend to be well armoured, therefore The Raised Fist are normally well armed. Of all the Syndicates, this is the one that gives the Star Enforcers most trouble.

Recruitment often occurs from disgruntled members of Nios who would prefer to take more action. Nios zealots are head hunted by The Raised Fist and quickly trained.

#### Organisation
The Raised Fist are organised much like Nios, with Branches spanning clusters. However, the lowest levels are group into Murder Squads. An Murder Squad, as the name suggests, is a group of operatives who are trained in slightly different areas so to make a more effective team. The size of a Murder ranges between 3 and 9, depending on their level of funding and density of Star Enforcers.

It is uncertain who funds The Raised Fist as those at the top of the hierarchy are unknown. There is very little structure between those with the money and power and the Murder Squads. Rumours have been spread that the higher powers of Nios are the very same as in The Raised Fist but this connection is impossible to prove.

#### Using The Raised Fist
It is astronomically difficult to use The Raised Fist. They operate solely on their own agenda. If a Murder Squad appears to be doing your bidding, it is because their masters share the same goals. They cannot be bought off, nor can they be distracted. The Undergaia can be used to find nearby Murder Squads but contact is rare.

#### Allies
- None.

### The Machine
The Machine are a technologist syndicate who believe that Automatons of a certain intelligence are sentient beings that should have the same rights as humans. The Machine support any of the Technologist Syndicates and actively fight against Humanist ones.

The Machine help Automatons that are ascending. In systems where ascension is a problem, the Machine will buy the Automatons and move them to a colony where their ascension can be fostered. This is the pleasant side of the Machine. Where an Automaton cannot be simply purchased, the owner will be forced to give it up - often under severe duress. Where Automatons have been abused, then The Machine will abuse the owner in the same manner.

#### Organisation
The Machine is organised on the Undergaia across a huge number of volumes. Information regarding Automaton abuses are fed in and action is decided upon. There are plenty members of the public who adopt Automatons and fund The Machine. It is believed that a few stand at the head of the organisation and provide its direction but those reports are difficult to confirm.

#### Using the Machine
The Machine are a useful syndicate to know as they can be used to cause havoc in Humanist locations. The Machine jump on any chance to give a human their comeuppance.

#### Allies
- Any Technology based syndicate: The Technomages, Crossed Arm and The Chrome.

### The Silver Blade
The Silver Blade is a Syndicate that acts as a support group and employment agency for assassins. The Silver Blade does not have a humanist or technological lean. They work to a set of rules for credits, regardless where the credits came from. Each assassin in the Silver Blade must adhere to the rules, even though the methods of assassination are varied. The Silver Blade is used by all the other Syndicates as well as rich private individuals with a score to settle.

The main rules (there are hundreds in total) of the Silver Blade are:

1. Half the payment is to be provided before, half after.
2. Discretion at all times.
3. Never admit to being a member of the Silver Blade.
4. If the task cannot be performed in the given time, then the money must be returned in full.
These rules have kept the integrity of the Silver Blade over many centuries.

#### Organisation
The Silver Blade is a flat organisation, there is no hierarchy. A series of intelligent, free-roaming Gaia entities perform the function of connecting clients with a suitable assassins. Each assassin pays a monthly fee to be a member and this pays for the creation of new Gaia entities when the Star Enforcers kill existing ones. Assassins wishing to join the Silver Blade must perform a series of jobs at a much reduced pay. Once joined, the Silver Blade member will be recognised on Gaia as a member and can be contacted for work.

#### Using the Silver Blade
The Silver Blade can be tricky to contact on the Undergaia (Taxing difficulty) and a new contact is required for each job that is needed. However, the Silver Blade are remarkably reliable and operate throughout Imperium Space. All this quality comes at a price. The more difficult the target, the more you pay. For an average member of the public, the price is approximately 8 000 and for a colony councillor, the price is nearer 100 000.

#### Allies
- Everyone and no-one.

### Tortrac Heds
The Tortrac Heds (or simply Heds) are a 'general troubleshooting' Syndicate. Their services include finding, stealing, killing, repairing, defending, hacking, partying, intimidating or doing any odd-job that you need. Their most distinguishing feature is that they are not reliable. Akin to the anarchistic Punks of the ancient 20th Century, the Heds are hell-bent on hedonism and bucking the 'system' (which is not always the Imperium). If you were to ask the Heds to retrieve an Akarakian sword, for example, they might well collect it before returning it to you, blade first.

Part of the Heds' charm is their drug fuelled energy.  When the Heds work for someone, they really go to work for them, with an energy and gusto you'd expect from children. However, much like children, they lose interest if the job takes an extended period of time so it is best to use the Heds for short and fun missions with plenty of room for error.

Although outrageous and flamboyant, they are also very good at resisting arrest. They can reign chaos onto a system and leave very little hard evidence that is was them. They operate fast and effectively, and rarely return to the same colony twice.

#### Organisation
The Heds group themselves into Gangs of between 10 and 50 Heds. A Gang nearly always operates from a spacecraft (if they lose it, they normally steal a new one). There is no organising body, Gangs will call themselves Heds as a way of demonstrating their mode of operation. Each Gang has a Governor who is Captain of the ship and arranges the work. It is through common interest and the Undergaia that these disparate groups are connected together as a single Syndicate. 

Each Gang is extremely competitive and they like to show off the tasks they perform, how close they got to the Star Enforcers without being arrested and how much money they earn. Throughout the Undergaia, there are unofficial lists of the best Gangs. The Gangs will support each other against a common enemy: one of the other Syndicates, the Imperium or a client who doesn't pay.

#### Using the Tortrac Heds
The Heds can appear elusive (they certainly are to the Star Enforcers) but they can be found on the Undergaia with a trained eye. Each Gang leaves Undergaia graffiti on the walls of Undergaia forums suggesting ways to contact them along with some marketing message regarding their unorthodox methods.

Contact is made through the Governor. They always ask for payment in full up front as they often have to disappear quickly into the void of space afterwards. The Heds are best used for actions that are not precise and incisive. The Heds often take payment in something other than cash.

#### Allies
- The Heds are rarely used by the other Syndicates.

## Recreation
One quarter of people's lives is spent in recreational pursuits. There is a huge number of different hobbies that people engage in from supporting a Planetball team to building gliders to glide above thermal vents. This section details a few of the more conventional ways of spending spare time.

### Physical Socialising
Still the most popular of all past times is having fun with friends. Physical Socialising (or 'In Fizz') is where people meet in the real world to listen to music, dance, chat, drink alcohol and take legal drugs. Each established Mex colony boasts a huge number of bars and clubs. Each bar and club is often run by Automatons, who can work around the 40 hour cycle. The Automaton personalities are chosen to fit the atmosphere the owner of the club or bar desires. This can range from rude through to submissive. 

Food and drink is ordered using Gaia menus that appear as colourful floating Hard Light holograms. It is served by either an Automaton or a simple hovering, self-propelling tray. In exclusive and expensive places, humans serve the food and drink.
Live music is rare in these clubs and bars, normally the musicians are on a far away system. They appear amongst the crowd as a hard-light projection, even though their physical body is light years away in a holoroom.

A large, flat area of the club or bar is normally reserved for dancing. In this area, people wriggle, step and gesticulate in time with the music while holographic shapes swim and burst around them. Those who take dancing more seriously have their own holographic shapes that move and shimmer in line with the dance moves of the owner. In this way, the owner controls the shapes and can create their own show.

In Fizz is preferable by most because it is possible to find and meet a sexual partner. This is partly possible in Gaia but procreation and the exchange of bodily fluids is not possible.

### Gaia Socialising
The next best form of socialising is within Gaia. This is almost identical to In Fizz socialising except that it is the Gaia Isis that actual does the contacting. Isis are idealised avatars of the people they represent, so Gaia tends to be filled with a disproportionately large number of attractive and well groomed people. Gaia Socialising is ideal for those who wish to meet people without physically leaving their home. People on spacecraft thousands of light years from any world can still keep in touch with people from their home planet.

More high tech Gaia rooms have an in-built Bioreorganiser that can make any food stuff (given the right entity to make it). Anyone using a high tech room like this can order food from their preferred restaurant and it will be made locally, wherever they are. 

### The Crossover
There is a crossover between In Fizz and In Gaia socialising. These are bars that are large Gaia holorooms (most are anyway) that allow Gaia Isis to mix with real people. These Crossover bars and clubs are popular to some but to many they are confusing because it is not obvious whether the person you are talking to is real or sitting on a spacecraft far away human occupied space. The only way for the real person to tell is to try and get the other person to leave the confines of the bar or club. If they are using Gaia, then they cannot leave.

### Gaia Alternaties
A Gaia Alternatity is an alternate world that persists somewhere in Gaia. Think of it as a virtual world game where people can play Characters in a different world. These worlds are very popular amongst those who wish to escape from their lives. Gaia Alternaties are often set in fantastic worlds or historical times.

### Gaia Interactives
A Gaia Interactive is a partially interactive story where the viewer can sit and watch the story as the creator intended or have an input into the events of the story to change its direction. Cheap Interactives are easy to come by but the number of choices available are few. More complex interactives have intelligent Gaia entities that respond more believably to events.

### Planetball
Planetball is a team sport that involves scoring goals by placing a ball through a hoop. The hoops are mounted on vehicles and both teams start on opposite sides of a planetoid.  A single Planetball game is normally played over a number of days and in that time, it can be possible to score 10 goals. 

Each team is equipped with a number of vehicles that the players can use to transport themselves and the ball. When players from opposing teams meet, there is normally a large amount of exciting inter-vehicle combat. The only weapon that is allowed in Planetball is the Ballgun, a device that can be used to propel the ball up to 1km. The ball itself is only 30cm across and made from a polyceramic material. It also has a Grav engine inside to allow it to propel itself depending on the spin and thrust the throwing player gives it. 

The Goal is usually mounted on the back of a Hauler and it is within that Hauler that the co-ordination of the team is performed.

Planetball teams have huge followings across Human Occupied Space and there are thousands of leagues, each containing hundreds of teams. In the top league are corporate and Imperial-sponsored teams with each of the Imperial Star Industries having a team (Star Fleet, Star Enforcers, Star Scientifica and Star Civilisation).

Although physically quite violent, in that players often get mangled in a high-speed accident, it is enjoyed by all ages - especially the top league where deaths are rare because the players are augmented.

There is big business in betting on Planetball leagues and merchandising.

### Rail Fighting
Rail Fighting is a blood sport whose rules vary depending on legality and location. Most colonies do not permit Rail Fighting but others actively encourage it, offering people a Gaia seat - for a fee (100 credits). Rail Fighting's roots is in boxing where two people are set against each other in a ring. In Rail Fighting, combatants fight in a circular room (normally with transparent walls). Around the edge is a rail 1.5 metres up from the floor. The combatants fight until one of them is unconscious or one hits the rail (either intentionally or not). 

From this basic set of rules, the deviations modify the format. Each modification has been given a name so that potential viewers know what to expect.

#### Full Blood
Notably played in the Tef Cluster in Dorian, the Full Blood version is a deadly version of the game. Each combatant is fitted with a health monitor that can sense death. Rather than unconsciousness, it is death that ends the fight. Weapons are often given to one or both of the combatants and the Rail around the edge cannot be used within the first 5 minutes of the game. This is the version that has given the sport its notoriety.
