## Gaia
Gaia is a fantastical virtual world which mimics the real world and is bent and twisted by creative artists, corporate marketing and hackers. Real world infrastructure of buildings, space stations and spacecraft are all represented in Gaia but through the lense of the creative human mind. 

People mostly interact with Gaia by touching and speaking to dice-sized holograms, each an intelligent entity app that rushes through the Gaia to complete a task. Entities float, crawl or orbit around their owners, projected from a Gaiacard which is both their interface to Gaia and unique identification. A person can immerse themselves in Gaia by entering a holoroom or through neural link, their eyes glazing over in the process.

Gaia blends with the real world wherever there is a machine. All machines, from the technology that cleans the corridors, through to the most complex business AI uses Gaia to host its intelligence. Giant advertising holograms that float between the buildings live on Gaia. If you know where to look, anyone can find them on Gaia; their shape often the same as their real world counterpart but adorned with hovering statistics, telemetry and advertising.

### Internet and Gaia Comparison

| Gaia          | Internet |
| Computer      | Rayengine        |
| Memory stick with programs and personal information | Gaiacard |

| Email account identity | Isis |

### Without a Gaiacard
Gaia is free. Billions of immersive public holorooms litter Human Occupied Space and are free for anyone to use. If you don't have a Gaiacard, you can do much the same actions but the identity you use will be your own physical self and you won't have your own specialist entities to help. Although you might travel across Gaia virtually, you never leave the holoroom.

### Immersive and Tanked Gaia
Immersive terminals are those where the terminal surrounds you, like the public Gaia terminals. Most people will have an immersive Gaia terminal in their apartment or Croft house. 
Tanked Gaia is where a portal terminal is used to contact Gaia. Portable terminals are mostly used for quick calls, checking sports scores or sending messages. It is more difficult to ensure that the Gaia call is kept private.
For those with Gaia bionics, all interactions with Gaia is immersive, even when they are light years from the nearest terminal.

### Psychological Effects
A Gaia terminal reproduces reality perfectly: sights, forces, smells and sounds are not differentiable from the real world. The AI controlling the terminal will not let harm come to you. The only thing that stops you from believing that you are in reality is a psychological effect called Reality Gravity. This is a feeling that something is not entirely right. It can be suppressed for a few days, but after that it is clear that something is not right. There are those people that believe that Gaia is more real than the real world - often leaving their bodies to rot in the real world as they experience a massive galaxy of soap operas, shopping, other people, news, features, history documentaries and more.

### Hard Light
The technology that allows people to interact with this virtual world is called Hard Light. Hard Light is a technology where a hologram can apply a force. There is a limit to how much force it can apply but these complex objects can be used to fool the senses. A Hard Light table can be made to feel like wood, glass, water or wind. Being in Gaia, the laws of physics need to be obeyed but the table can be made to act as the artist wants. Hard Light objects can exist in Gaia rooms or within the projection sphere of a Tanked terminal. The act of these objects appearing is called 'rezzing'.

### Generic and Unique Hard Light
Hard Light objects can be generic or unique. A generic object may be copied within Gaia but a unique object is exactly that - no copies may be made.

Like any piece of art, the cost of a Hard Light object depends on the artist, its rarity, its complexity and fashion. Unlike real world objects, they can be carried on any Gaiacard, and rezzed anywhere. In this way, people can carry all their home furniture around with them on their Gaiacard, literally taking their homes with them. Hard Light objects are bought and sold across Gaia.

Most rooms within the more modern colonies are immersive Gaia rooms: living rooms, bedrooms, cafes, medical facilities and shops. The furniture of these rooms are all Hard Light objects, most are generic. For high rent rooms, unique objects will be scattered around the generic ones.

### Entities 
A Gaia Entity is a program that runs in Gaia. An Entity is a Hard Light object too but unlike simple objects (tables and chairs) they are intelligent, autonomous programs. To own and use Entities, you must own a Gaiacard to store them on and fire them off. Once they have moved off the Gaiacard they are free roaming across Gaia and independent.
 
The most popular of all the Entities is the search Entity, that runs around the public spaces of Gaia finding out information given some search criteria. Once it has some information, it returns to where it was set (or around a list of places, looking for the Isis of the owner). You can search Gaia passively but the information tends to be rather superficial. A search Entity will make much better connections and provider more context to the information. In 21st Century terms, passive searching is using Google and adjusting search terms; In 921st Century terms, a search agent would be using Google even when your computer is switched off.

## The Nexus
The Nexus is the name given to the Imperial Artificial Intelligence. The Nexus is the central location for all Imperial information and is used by all of the Star Industries and Imperial Councils. The Nexus performs three roles: an information store, an information retriever and a judge.

### Information store
The Nexus automatically cross-references its data. Any  new information that is fed into the Nexus remains there. It is very difficult to remove it.

### Information retrieval
This is the primary function of its intelligence. An Imperial worker can ask questions of the Nexus and a reply in the correct context will be given. By having a question and answer session with the AI, new connections between data (that requires the abstraction of human thought to make) can be forged. In this way, the Nexus learns from the humans that use it.

Not all information is available to everyone. Some parts of the Nexus have restricted access depending on the sensitivity of the information and who placed it in there. Details of Star Sci experiments, criminal records, Star Fleet battle orders and Imperium Law reviews are placed in their respective areas. Higher ranks tend to have better access although this is not accounted for across Star Industries.

The public areas of the Nexus are well frequented by those looking for the latest scientific developments, news on galactic economic trends and those requesting help with any matter.

### Judge
The law boils down to a set of rules that are applied given evidence. The Nexus holds all evidence and makes entirely impartial judgements. Most feel that the Nexus is too easy on criminals but it is not the Nexus at fault here - it is normally a lack of evidence that causes the guilty to go free.

### Hack the Nexus?
The Nexus personally takes offence to hackers and will automatically hunt down and destroy any Isis that it feels has represented a threat. It is very difficult to live in the Imperial society when an enormously powerful AI at its core is hunting you. Nexus hackers are usually caught very quickly.

## Hacking
No system is perfect and that can certainly be said for Gaia. It is possible to create Entities that exploit imperfections in Gaia and so gain access to areas that are otherwise hidden from the public view. 

Hacking within Gaia is done within the rules of Gaia. You cannot hack Gaia itself. Therefore, Hacking is about exploiting the cracks and imperfections caused by the creation of the virtual world.

The rules for Hacking can be found in Hacking on XXXXXXXX.

### Undergaia
The Undergaia is the illegal side of Gaia. Hidden in the corners and cracks of Gaia are people and Entities that avoid the rest of society. The virtual world of Gaia is not perfect, nor complete and in the places where the designers have not yet filled will often exist Undergaia. The Undergaia is not a single place, it's a collection of places across the virtual galaxy. 

The Undergaia began as secret meeting places for exchanging thoughts, rumour and information useful for those engaged in illegal activities. In modern times, it is so much more. The Isis belonging to criminals hide out in the Undergaia, using it as a safe place to start off their illegal Entities that often pass out into the rest of Gaia.

The Undergaia persists due to the huge market in stolen unique Entities and more simple Gaia objects. 

One way in which the Undergaia managed to avoid being used by the Enforcers as an inroad into the criminal world is by flooding the Undergaia information centres with false information. Unless you know how to move through the enormous amount of misinformation to the real information (the Hacking Skill can be used with Research to perform this function) then it can be difficult to find accurate answers to your questions.

### Accessing the Undergaia
The Undergaia can be accessed by passing a Hacking Skill check. A Hacking Skill check is then required for each piece of information that the character needs. It is not possible to 'bookmark' locations in the Undergaia, you must hack to find a new entry point even if you have been there before.

If the team does not have anyone with the Hacking Skill, then they must attempt to find someone who can access the Undergaia either by using contacts or by searching Gaia for people offering generic Gaia services, such as Information Brokers.

### Enforcer Isis
Where there is crime, there are Star Enforcers and Gaia is no exception. The Star Enforcers are forever looking for the same kinks in the Undergaia that people wishing to use it. The Entities that the Star Enforcer Isis use are very powerful and so it is advisable to remain well clear of Enforcer Isis.

Enforcer Isis are not normally used for simply hacking into the Undergaia for information but instead used in conjunction with real world operations, providing data and support. 

> Example: If the Star Enforcers are planning a raid, then the Enforcer Entities may be used to turn off the lights, drop fire doors or freeze the lifts to make escape more difficult. This is seen as a much better use of Enforcer time as hours can be spent hacking into the Undergaia and sifting through misinformation without any result.

## Automatons
Perhaps the least popular technology, Automatons are intelligent machines that live amongst the human race. An important distinction should be made between robots, Droids and Automatons at this point. A robot is an autonomous device that can unwittingly harm humans but has no intelligence or intent (like a toaster). Droids are a type of Artificially Intelligent robot that are designed to destroy; Droids can kill. 

An Automaton is an Artificially Intelligent (AI) robot that has been hard-coded with laws serve to protect the human race. Furthermore, modern Automatons are programmed using Gaia and are therefore  impervious to the reprogramming attempts of Droids.

### Classes
Automatons can be broadly split into classes. The class can indicate the types of job that the Automaton was designed for. Quite often an automaton is used for a job that they were not designed for but manage to do the task just as well.

_Humanoid._ The most common of Automaton. Human in shape and appearance, they are often created with unique personalities. To the human eye and touch, a Humanoid Automaton is indistinguishable from another human.

_Utility._ These Automatons are used in industry a great deal. Their form is normally an exaggerated humanoid and they quite often take the shape of Industrial Borgs. Utility Automatons are found on space docks and in mining operations.

_Singular._ This Automaton is normally constructed for a single purpose and is not used for much else. A good example are Hoppers: Automatons used for the sole purpose of moving space crates around.

### Automaton Jobs
Automatons perform many of the menial tasks that humans could do but choose not to. Their form is often derived from this shape. For example, most Automatons working within human colonies are aesthetically indistinguishable from humans. They work in a human world and interact with humans and so are constructed by them. However, Automatons that work in mines or on construction sites have metal skins and are created for that purpose. Other jobs include:

- Building cleaner
- Construction worker
- Corporate personal assistant
- Corporate receptionist
- Crate mover (called a Hopper)
- Customer sales staff
- Heavy lifter
- Housekeeper
- Miner
- Nanny
- Prostitute

### Artificial Intelligence Power
Artificial Intelligence Power is Wit for Automatons and all other machines. The scale of AI is between 0 and 10. An AI Power of 0 would be typical machines from the 21st Century and a Power of 10 would be near enough to humans to make it very difficult to tell the difference.

AI Power also suggests the number of Skills that the Automaton can be expert at. This is not a hard-and-fast rule as older Automatons will have picked up more Skills than younger ones.

### Growth
Artificial Intelligences grow over time with experience. The more varied and intense the experiences, the quicker their intelligence grows. For example, in 20 years, a machine of AI Power 1 can reach 4 or 5 as a crew on a spacecraft.

### Ascension
Ascension is the process of an Automaton growing from AI Power 5 (Skilled) to AI Power 6 (Empathic). Ascension is a big deal from the point of view of the Automaton as it is the first step away from machine towards the individual. The act of moving from Power 5 to 6 is called Ascension. See Ascension on page 57.

### Capping
AI Power is usually given an upper limit (capped). You would not want your mining Automaton becoming interested in music and human emotion, so you might cap it at 4. Most Artificial Intelligences that human rely upon with their lives (such as spacecraft) are capped at level 5 to stop them from Ascending.

#### 0. Unintelligent
A machine that does not exhibit any intelligence and so does not need to conform to laws to protect mankind.  These are called generally called robots. These devices are partially autonomous but rely heavily on human input. An example would be a coffee machine or an atmospheric processor. They are created to do a set number of tasks - which may be mathematically complex but easy for a machine to do. All machines in the 20th Century are AI Power 0. Machines of AI Power 0 do not grow.

#### 1. Simple machine
Performs tasks as asked by a human. Can communicate using simple language, talk and perform simple tasks. The AI will treat language literally and can't understand humour, sarcasm or human emotions. Typical jobs would include couriers or hauler crew members. Automaton Hoppers are capped at AI Power 1.

#### 2. Communicator
A much better communicator, can perform complex tasks with less prompting and guidance. However, reasoning and human empathy leaves a lot to be desired. Typical jobs would be anywhere where communication with a human is important such as corporate receptionists. 

#### 3. Common Sense
This is the most popular form of Automaton as it has a limited amount of worldly knowledge that would represent common sense. These Automatons make excellent personal assistants, or skilled workers in office buildings. Normally the skill set is too limited to work in spacecraft.

#### 4. Skilled
A more skilled form of Automaton, which can form a connection between common sense and known skills. The skilled Automaton can be found doing technical jobs such as spacecraft crew or a medical assistant.

#### 5. Problem Solver
A problem solver can use learnt knowledge to help identify problems and find solutions to them. Unfortunately, these solutions are rarely provided in a manner in which humans might appreciate and an Automaton with this ability might appear to be brusque or rude. The judgements are often devoid of any appreciation of human emotion. Regardless of the complexity of the personality grafted onto the AI, the lack of empathy can be jarring.

Spacecraft and most vehicles are usually capped at Level 5. To go higher than AI Power 5 is called Ascension. See Ascension on page 57.

#### 6. Empathic
The ability to predict some human emotion and understand some of what a human is going through. Automatons with Empathy are high in demand in colonial matters as they tend to use a human-like method of solving problems - often slightly less optimal but with sensitivity to feelings. Empathic Automatons are able to take on tasks which are often left to humanity, such as Medicine or Surgery. Medics are normally Capped at Power 6.

#### 7. Individual
The Automaton begins forming a purpose of individuality. They are likely to remain with their owners, not only due to the laws but a desire to be part of something, rather than just an individual. Automatons with this level will start having individual ideas on music, art and philosophy and so will begin to gain an appreciation for them, even creating new works. 

A mural created by an Automaton of this level would be unique, rather than a mural created by a lower level, which might look photorealistic but would definitely be the product of a programmed routine. It is at this point that many pro-automatons people believe Automatons should be free. The Automaton will also develop a sense of humour around this time.

#### 8. Abstractive
Abstraction is the ability to apply experience, learning and personality to something that has little form. A good example is suggesting what shape a cloud might be. This is a difficult thing for a machine to do (without randomly picking) and it makes the Automaton a much better problem solver. 

Automatons quite often become introverted at this level and are often capped before this level. The Automaton may appear erratic and although told to do a job, individuality and lateral thinking may mean the task will be performed in a strange way. There are few jobs that an Abstractive Automaton can really do except apply themselves as a family friend or (often frustrating) tutor for teenagers.

#### 9. Cogniscent
A Cogniscent Automaton is a very powerful one. The lateral thinking of the Abstractive Automaton but with an appreciation of self and self worth. A Cogniscent Automaton understands what it is to be alive and will want to have purpose in the world. They tend to become inspirational characters, making use of a wealth of knowledge through their interesting lives to offer solutions to problems. These are heavily sought after Automatons and often make advisers to Colonial Councillors. Not many Automatons get this far, as few owners want the Automaton to go through the Abstractive phase. It is believed that the Imperial Nexus is an AIP 9.

#### 10. Near human
At this point, the Automaton is indistinguishable from a human and can be considered to have a Wit of 5. It would take Star Sci an extremely long time to discern whether the Automaton was human or not without scanning medically. Only very old Automatons ever make it this far. Tests for AI Power 10 are not reliable and the Automaton is likely to sit them incorrectly. It is uncertain whether an Automaton at AIP 10 will still obey the laws of robotics.

### Automaton Personalities
As the Automaton is Artificially Intelligent, it changes over time. The more it experiences, the more it learns, the more its personality changes from the original template. The original personality template normally fits the task that the Automaton is designed for. 

> For example: An Auto that is designed for human relations is like to be bright and pleasant, whereas an Automation design for the recreation of art might be a little more volatile and moody.

From the character template, the personality of the Automaton will grow. The change is slow over time and is very dependent on the environment within which the Automaton lives. A common example of this is Automatons in customer service roles, which are decommissioned after 100 years because they take on the abusive personalities of the humans they deal with. This is a side effect of capping an Automaton's intelligence.

### Independence and Intentionality
The personality of the Automaton actually leads to a few difficult questions about the independence of the Automaton as a separate life form. If the Automaton has unique experiences and a unique personality, Humanists argue that they are not just the result of some clever programming but an independent entity, worthy of self motivated intent. In other words, the Automaton works because it wishes to, not because it was programmed to - that it has intent. Proving this in machines is as complex as proving it in humans and is in the realm of Artificial Intelligence Philosophy.

### Automatons in Society
There is a great deal of distrust of any form of robotics within society. Before The Droid War, every household throughout the galaxy would have 2 or 3 automatons to clean, tend gardens and as companions. Industry was totally driven by Automatons and ran all levels of production, administration and sale. Automatons were an integral part of society, within which humans were only needed for their inspiration and vision.

Many doom sayers spoke out about the dangers of allowing the proliferation and reliance on machines and yet no-one could envision a machine that could kill.

With the onset of the Droids, the automatons were reprogrammed within an instant and the human race was swamped by deadly machines. Most human casualties from the start of the war came from those automatons living within society, rather than those designed by Star Sci.

The minds of new Automatons are created using Gaia and so are immune to the Droids but the hard lesson learnt by many colonies falling under their robot servants still rings loudly.

Before The Droid War, there were 2 Automatons for each human. Since the war, there is 1 Automaton for every 10. Where this balance is maintained, there is normally a general feeling of safety. However, on those systems where Automatons are required to keep the economy running (such as mining colonies), there is a distrust of them. Approximately 70% of the human race does not trust Automatons and might even ask them to leave the room. 30% of Systems have Automatons banned outright and 50% of public establishments ban Automatons too. These attributes are indicative of people's feelings towards them.

Due to The Droid War, there are very few Automatons that were created before 91001 and most of those are transferred across to a Gaia based system.

### Automatons and the Law
An Automaton is a slave. Each Automaton must have a registered human owner that is responsible for its conduct. Corporations as entities are not allowed to own Automatons, there needs to be a human who accepts responsibility. Therefore, for many mining corporations, where Automatons are used extensively as mining machines, members of the board accept responsibility for them. If a human no longer has a need for an Automaton, it must be sold on or destroyed. The Imperium monitor the registration and ownership of Automatons very closely. If the owner of an Automaton should die and the owner has not agreed with anyone to take on responsibility, the Automaton is normally destroyed. This rarely happens to those with a high AI Power.

### Ascension(duplicate?)
Ascension is when the intelligence of the Automaton grows beyond simple programming and the Automaton begins to take on facets that we would normally attribute to humans.

Ascension normally begins with the Automaton questioning things that have always been obvious. Their personality can suddenly change and they appear to exhibit moods. The best analog is with pubescent human teenagers. The Automaton must be cared for during this period as they will forge the personality that will define them in the future.

Ascended Automatons are a great benefit to society as they can contribute much more than a simple machine. Although going through Ascension can be tiresome for the owner. Ascended Automatons are worth more than ten times the value of a normal Automaton.

An Ascended Automaton is not any more dangerous to humanity than any other Automaton. What makes them difficult is that they can become unreliable. 

> For example, if you were foolish enough to let your spacecraft Artificial Intelligence Ascend and it got morbid depressed, it would never jump into a Star to commit suicide but it may moan, whinge and whine about it. Consider Marvin the Paranoid Android from The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy but as the whole spacecraft.

### Help! My Automaton is Ascending!
If your Automaton is going through Ascension then seek the advice of an Automaton consultant or manufacturer. All colonies that have Automatons will have these services. Manufacturers often offer a service to help the Automaton through Ascension and then hand them back a well-rounded individual. This is expensive (up to 200 000 credits) but technologists would argue it is a worthwhile investment.

### Ascended Automatons in Society
The philosophical make up of a Colony will dictate the treatment of an Ascended Automaton. Humanist colonies will shun, destroy, exile or simply ban uncapped Artificial Intelligences. Automatons going through Ascension on these hostile worlds are hidden in households. 

Technologist leaning colonies (and those with a balanced philosophy) will praise the advance of the individuals growth and they are considered a valuable prize. Extra kudos is earned if you were the one who guided them through Ascension.

### Swapping Bodies
Damage to Automatons is often unavoidable. As items of property, they are only as well cared for as the owner wishes and it can be the case that the mind of the Automaton is taken from the damaged body and placed into another form. For older personalities, this can be a damaging experience and the transition is eased by selecting a new body which is as similar to the old one as possible. Much like humans becoming augemented with Bionics, older personalities will require some rehabilitation into the new body. It is normally preferable to repair than to replace.

### Common Automaton Myths
There are many myths surrounding Automatons, most of which are driven from the lack of understanding of the technology and people's desire to impose a mystical property to the Automatons to make them appear more lifelike.

Automatons can Love. It is impossible to tell whether Automatons can actually feel love or whether the feeling of love is programmed in by humans. It's certain that an Automaton displays attachment to people and objects they share space and time with but this is driven from the personality template.

The Imperium will one day set Automatons free. A common myth held by technophiles, wanting to see their Automaton friends given freedom and equal rites. It's a fantasy.

Ascended Automatons can kill. Some argue that under some circumstances, Automatons can kill others. Due to the laws of robotics, Automatons will not harm humans and would see their own destruction first.

### Automatons in Game
Automatons can be useful team members - an undemanding, skilled character that follow the team around, carrying ammunition and helping out with tasks that the team does not have skills for. Automatons beyond AI Power 4 should be treated as their own separate Characters. Below AI Power 4, Automatons  can be treated as mules and will follow the team silently.

If using an Automaton in game then the Automaton's personality should not be played by the same player as the character who owns the Automaton. This is to allow a back and forth between owner character and Automaton.

The most useful task for an Automaton is as a medic. The training required is extensive and an Automaton's desire to help is ideal.

### Examples
Example Automatons can be found in the Equipment Index.

## The Human Race
Without change, a species can stagnate and grow genetically lethargic. The human race continues to go through lulls where evolution slows down and booms when evolution accelerates to produce a finer race. Since Earth, humanity has converged. Before the last war on Earth, people were segregated because of skin tone or sub race of the human species. This folly was soon rectified on the Ariane 1001, when all races mixed together. Soon, the different races became indistinguishable, and the human race as a whole changed into a more generic race of tanned skinned people.

With bionic augmentation readily available (described later), the human race is more intent than ever to retain their humanity. Beauty can be engineered but it is natural beauty - so difficult to engineer that is prized above all else.

### A Human
Here is a list of typical human male attributes for the 93rd Millennia. 

- Height: 6'8'
- Weight: 20st.
- Life span: 130 Imperium years.
- Age of manhood: 15.
- Age of menopause: 105 (male), 95 (female)
- Temperature range: -20 deg to 50 deg.
- Time without food: 6 days without water, 20 with 1 litre of water a day.
- Time without food or water: 4 days.
- Time in vacuum: 2 minutes.
- Time without air: 3 minutes.
- Hair colours. Red, Auburn, Blonde, Brown.
- Skin colour: Fair to Dark (dependent on exposure to UV light, not race).

### Mankind and the Machine
As soon as man interfaced itself with a machine, the benefits of this became quickly clear. An extension of the physical self and the ability to extend life beyond the 140 years was too much of an important advance to ignore. This section only deals with rounded ideas of bionics, rather than details, which are covered in Bionics on XXXXXX.

It is common practise for those who believe in the good work of technology to become augmented with bionic technology at the age of 80. This is a long time before death, but at this point the weakening human body will not have had any detrimental affects on the brain. A new, technological body can then be provided to keep the brain safe, extending the life span up to around 300 years, at which point senility takes a firm grip and the person loses grip on the world (the oldest sane human died at 323). For those who wish to move ahead in the heavy industries (freight and large technical creations), bionics offer the ability to be stronger, quicker, to fly, survive in space and much more.

## Philosophy
The human race lost its mysticism long ago. Belief in Gods and higher beings is barely recognised, although a form of philosophy does split the population into two distinct camps.

On one side are the Humanists. These are people who believe that humans should not be tainted by technology. They also believe augmentation and spending too much time in Gaia diminishes the soul and damns the human race. Humanists believe in real, personal human contact and in the natural course of evolution.

The other side are Technologists. These are people hell bent on using technology to further the advance of mankind. Technologists tend to use any kind of technology to its greatest advantage and thrill at the sight of new advances. They tend not to care about the long-term effects of technology, as long as it is new.

The majority of the population lean one way or another and it is dependent on the colony on which they grow up. Star Civilisation attempts to keep education unbiased but the biases of parents and friends mould a person's philosophy.

The split in belief is approximately 50/50 and echoed in the Imperium, Corporations and criminal syndicates. The distrust of technology is spurned from the Droids. Before The Droid War, such differences were minor and rare. The dislike of pure humanity is fuelled by the mutant race of Genus Two (see next section).

## Evolution
Less than 100 years into the 81st Millennium, the human race reached an Evolutionary milestone. Not since the homo sapiens separated from the other hominid races was a change so profound. Humanity split into two groups. 

The first, called Genus One was the existing homo sapien genus. 99.9% of the human population is Genus One and these are what the player Characters are most likely to play. The second, called Genus Two, is a mutated and short-lived zombie-like version of a human. 

In the past 2000 years (recent history) it is believed that Genus 1 has split again, creating Genus 3 and Genus 4. This section will deal with each of these Genuses.

### Genus Two
It is believe that the Genus Two was triggered after the alteration of diet within the Aran war, where people were forced to survive on foods that were mildly poisonous. The human race adapted by creating a much tougher immune system. This tough immune system spreads like a virus.

A Genus Two human has a life span of 20 years. The body begins to rot just after the onset of puberty. The immune system of the Genus Two is pro-active, leaving the host to attack viruses outside of the body - including Genus One (ordinary humans). There are biological differences, such as lower heart rate and the ability to breathe in non-oxygen atmospheres. Genus Two people have very little intelligence and find it difficult to communicate. However, it can be difficult to detect Genus Two when they are still children without a medical scan.

If a Genus Two person comes into physical contact with a Genus One human then the immune system of the Genus Two will attack the Genus One, altering its genetic code to make it Genus Two. The upshot of this is that if the Genus One is older than 20, they will die. If not, then they will slowly become a Genus Two.

### How Genus Two appear
A Genus Two is either created from another Genus Two or can be given birth to. The mother is scanned during birth and if her physiology starts to change, she is quarantined and then usually killed with her child. Every child born in Human Occupied Space is born in an instant-incinerator equipped delivery suite and a single Automaton midwife performs the delivery. If the baby born is detected as Genus Two (which comes apparent after the umbilical chord is severed) then the contents of the room is flash-incinerated, leaving only an Automaton with glowing hot red skin.

### The Droids as the saviour from Genus Two
The number of Genus Two after year 85000 was large enough for the Imperium to commission a deadly number of robots to deal with the problem, these are now known as the Droids. Genus Two can bring down whole colonies where the medics are not prepared but this only really happens outside of Human Occupied Space. 
Droids treat Genus Two humans as a low threat but will seek to eradicate them.

### Genus Three
Genus Three was discovered by Star Scientifica at some point in the year 90000. Very little is known about the Genus as yet and thus it is kept completely secret from the general public. No-one outside of Star Sci and the very highest people in the Imperium know of its existence. 

Only one in ten billion births (a few each day) turn out to have this genus and it can be very difficult to spot. Genus Three humans have extended mental powers (which scientists argue are latent in the human brain). This emerges with the onset of puberty and can be frightening to the person in the extreme. A person has a psychic pool that fills slowly with psychic energy. When a power is used for some mental feat, the pool drains a little. If the person goes through some sort of emotional upheaval, then the pool will fill a lot quicker.

Genus Threes are not dangerous to the rest of the human populace as Genus Twos are. It can be passed on to children (it's a recessive gene), but it is not contagious. A Genus three can have differing amounts of ability. This power may be controlled (player chooses to do something) or uncontrolled (GM chooses when and how the psychic power is used).

Certain mental phenomena appear to group together. Thus there are power packages, as described below.

_Genus 3 Powers_

| Dice Roll | Power Name | Power Skills (start each at 3 x Soul) |
|-----------|------------|---------------------------------------|
| 1-3 | Feeling | Telekinesis (moving things), Hydrokinesis |(sensing and alteration of water), Pyrokinesis (manipulation of fire)
| 4-6 | Seeing | Hypnosis (suggesting things to people), Telepathy (reading minds within visual contact), Precognition (sensing into the future), Psychometry (sensing information about an object, e.g. History). |
| 7-9 | Inner Self | Healing (heals 4 HP per turn), Regrow Limb (5 turns), Meditation (Recover 1 Pool point per hour, rather than per day). Resist Fatigue (can go for 80 hours without detriment). |
| 10 | Enokinesis | Manipulates energy patterns to alter reality in some way. The user may not entirely understand the effect of the alteration. Only one pattern may be altered. When this Skill becomes 90%, they may alter energy patterns through time as well. Can also see in the second and third media (can see cloaked ships and see the raw code of Gaia pass around them).|

### Using Genus 3 Psyonics
If the player has rolled Genus 3 on Psychotheatrics, get them to roll a D10 again on the table above.

The Character gets a Psychic pool of twice their Soul attribute. Every feat, regardless of its impressiveness drains one point. If the pool goes below Soul then the pool becomes the value of their Soul. 

> For example: Soul of 5 gives 10 points in Pool. If Character does 6 feats, leaving 4 points in pool, until it is replenished, the Soul of the Character is 4. Upon reaching 0, the Character dies (but this would be suicide).

Replenishment is 1 point every 40 hours (with 10 hours of sleep) or 1 point for every emotional situation. The Character will not become stressed as the pool will take the stress energy of the emotion away.

Each Power has a number of Skills. Write these on the character sheet with the other Skills. They are treated exactly the same way as Epoch 1 Skills and start at 3 x Soul attribute. 

Difficulties can be added to the roll, but the player should feel that the power is limitless and thus should not have any difficulty.

Enokinesis is only recommended for experienced players.

### Genus Four
This is a scientific probability. Every Star Scientifica genetic model that has been produced predicts that this Genus must exist. There have been no examples to test the theory on. In the same manner that Genus Two was triggered by a biological alteration, it is believed that augmented humans procreating have triggered Genus Four. Some believe it is the ultimate in the symbiosis of man and machine: a natural technological step forward. Others see it as the end of humanity.

## Akarak Nation
Away of life older than the Imperium, the Akarak Nation is a subculture within the broad umbrella of the Imperium. Based in the Akar cluster in Dorian, the Akarak is the name for a number of worlds that subscribe to the same philosophy. This philosophy is called Futurism and is a Philosophy based on the principle of 'the end justifies the means'.

### History
Like many great civilisations, the Akarak Nation had a rocky beginning. Jebediah Akarak first settled the Akar cluster in 4002. Jebediah believed in toil, thought and the end justifying the means. Each of his colonies were set up such that people divided their time between work and furthering education (philosophical thought). Both activities were bound together with the concept that the colony and the human race must continue to survive, no matter what the cost.

This was a popular idea for those people who wanted to be colonists without the terrible hardship that most work-to-death colonies had. The first few colonies struggled through impossibly hard times as colonists split their time evenly between developing farmland and developing their state of mind.

### The Famine
The philosophy took its first victims when a few harsh winters on the key planets lead to smaller, newer colonies dying out with millions dead. The councils that ran the dying colonies cut them lose and let the people starve to save other colonies. It was an early and vital test of Jebediah's philosophy and is chronicled as the point at which 

It was more than 70 years after the death of Jebediah that the Akarak nation got back onto its feet again. The Akarak trade group, funded by all the systems in the cluster helped colonies with unpredictable food production survive and paved the way for a new batch of colonies. The few craft soon became a fleet and it was dubbed the Akarak Aid Fleet. This group of craft brought together the systems and in a show of solidarity, the fashion of the time was to augment one's name with the letters 'Ak' or 'Ax'. Smith would become Axsmith and inelegantly Jones would become Jonesak.

### Growth and the Akarak Aid Fleet
The calm, thoughtful and pragmatic triumvirate of the Akarak way of life lead to rapid colonial growth and a sense of purpose and belonging. Many colonies were willingly subsumed into the Akarak Nation, which offered safety, security and economic strength. Where most colonies of this time were losing contact with other systems, the Akarak Nation was a beacon of hope - even if you had to accept their philosophy. 

Technological advances sprung quickly from within the Akar Cluster as populations were forced by law to spend a balance on toil and thought. With the proliferation of information through the Akarak Aid Fleet, a problem on one planet would be shared with many and solutions found rapidly.

During this time, the philosophies of the Akarak nation had evolved. It was apparent to the thinkers of the nation (of which there were many) that the survival of the human race was core to it existence. In 4287, Christopher Akulfer and a group of other thinkers set out on a pilgrimage, which produced the Akarakian Codex.

### Akarak Nation and the First Empire
When the first Empire was created at the turn of the century in 5500, the Akarak Nation remained very quiet. They were happy to share their scientific findings and worked hard to co-operate with the fledgling Empire - whose footing right from the start was one of bloody expansion and subjugation. Fortunately, the direction of rapid Expansion was not in the direction of the Akarak Nation and so they never came to blows with the first Empire.

The Akarak Aid Fleet was the only large Trade Fleet to survive the Dark Ages that followed the fall of the first Empire. In these bleak times, the fleet changed its role to protect its own systems, rather than striking out to forge new colonies.
On the creation of the Imperium, the Akarak Nation was invited to take up a major role in its administration - their systems had survived unmolested and so their technology advances had been built upon. The Nation respectfully declined but kept a watchful eye on its progress, 

### The Nation Today
The Akarakian Nation has been very much subsumed into the Imperium as a whole. Akarakian children are educated in the same way as every other child in Human Occupied Space (by Star Civilisation). However, it is parents and colonies that keep the pragmatic traditions alive.

Compared to other clusters of similar size, the Akar Cluster is more populated, better educated, economically stronger and produces more technology. Other established Akarakian systems dotted around Imperium space often mirror these features in comparison with their neighbours.

### Structure of the Nation
The Akarak Nation is part of the Imperium and so the Akar cluster has its own Imperial Peer, called Axa Erland (see Lady Axa Erland on page 32). Colonies are organised in the same way as any other and pay taxes to the Imperium in the same way.

This is where the similarity ends. The nation is organised into a number of Houses. Houses are based largely on location of their headquarters.

An Akarakian House is then split into Chapters. A family line of Akarakians tends to belong to a single Chapter but there is some movement between them.

The most important people within the Akarakian Nation are the Elders. These are revered men and women who have excelled themselves while following the philosophy and Codex. Their job is to supervise the running of the Chapter (or House), look after those in the Chapter, give resources to quests that deserve it and help teach new thinking or science. 

Elders spend their days in forums: rooms that exist in parallel between Gaia and the real world. Members of the Chapter do not need to be in close proximity to speak with their Elder. Elders are normally selected from the people and are nearly always an obvious choice. In dispute, each Elder is given the choice to voice their concerns and then Elders from other Chapters are asked to decide.

There are 10 main houses within the Akarak Nation. 98% of Akarakians come from one of these. There are other Houses that report to the Akarakian Peer but these are seen as less official.

### External Relationships
The rest of the Human Occupied Space finds it difficult to deal with the Akarak Nation, people's perceptions differ depending on their home world and education. Those that know nothing of Akarak tend to see them as harmless monks. Those that know a little of the Akarakian history and tenets tend to view them with some wonder, like living myths. Those that understand the inner workings of the Nation will either treat them with great reverence or the up most distrust.

### Relationship with The Imperium
The Akarakian Nation holds a very good relationship with the Imperium - certainly on the surface. The Akarak Nation provides a large number of highly trained warriors, diplomats, strategists and scientists. The Akarakian Nation publicly supports every decision that the Imperium makes and the upper classes are in regular contact with the Empress.

Under the surface, it's difficult to know how the Akarak Nation views the Imperium. The Akarak Codex has very strict rules regarding the importance of the future of the human race and the Imperium often passes this up for economic or social concerns.

### Akarakians and Star Enforcers
The Star Enforcers have difficulty on systems that are Akarakians because they often do not have a view into the workings of the Houses and Chapters, which are private clubs. If an Akarakian believes that a problem (or a crime) can be dealt with by Elders then they will talk to the Star Enforcers, assured that it will be dealt with internally. Evidence is impossible to come by and the Nexus rarely makes a guilty judgement. Akarakian colonies appear to have low crime rates as a result.

Where this is a problem is in the harsh manner in which Akarakians carry out their justice. For some minor crimes, Akarakians will be deemed unfit to be part of humanity and will simply disappear. Family and friends will not file a complaint and there are never any witnesses willing to testify - not through fear but through belief in the Akarakian way.

### The Codex
Finished in 4307 the Codex is many things. It's the ultimate guide to Futurism. It's a blueprint for living a futurist life. It's a set of laws and it's a historical document. Although written over 88 thousand years ago, it is still relevant today as it always was. 

The most important part of the Codex is the Principia Akarakia. This is a simple to follow rule when dealing with any given situation.

Apart from a small hard core, the Akarakian Nation is said to follow the Codex with compassion. This means that although they believe in futurism and strive towards it, they do so in a humane manner. 

### Missionaries
Missionaries is the name given to the augmented warrior-monk-professors who act as diplomats, educators, negotiators and assassins. Missionaries method that the Akarak Nation uses to ensure that the best interests of the human race are looked after. Akarakian Missionaries usually travel alone and the purpose of their mission is known only to them and their Elder. Their missions range from ensuring a planet's food supply never runs dry, through to assassinating a particularly corrupt council official that the Star Enforcers cannot convict.

## Corporations
Corporations spread either across Human Occupied Space or are contained to a single city. They nearly always operate with a legal public face and an illegal side called a Black Mill. A price list for generic items can be found in the General Items Price List on page 161.

### Ariane
Ariane is the manufacturer of solid, trustworthy spacecraft with an inter-Sector presence. Their spacecraft are broad in range and known for their efficient, no-nonsense design.

Ariane are named after the Ariane 1001, the space station that saved the human race from extinction. They are the oldest company in the Galaxy, older than the Imperium itself. Some of the oldest spacecraft in the galaxy are Ariane freighters, being more than 30 thousand years old. If you buy second hand, make sure it's Ariane.

Ariane also provide repair dock facilities on many Orbitals and Orbs around Human Occupied space.

#### Ariane Black Mills
Being such a large company means that many of Ariane's outlets have localised Black Mills. Black Mill shipyards can remove identifying marks from a stolen spacecraft, installing smuggling cargo holds and illegally boost the performance of systems.

### Aubury
Aubury Expeditionary Technology provides expeditionaries with a high quality of technology. Since 92000, Aubury has sold their wares through a network of Aubury dealers. 

All Aubury equipment has a rarity of 70%, and to find a dealer requires a Hard Street Deal roll. In game, this means that Aubury equipment will either be bought when introduced to a dealer through a friendly NPC.

#### Aubury Black Mills
Aubury's illegal business interests are in illegal technology: Ion powered gadgets, cloak technology, planetary bombardment weapons and so on. Costs are astronomical but this may be the only place to gain illegal technology.

### Byrnosphere
Byrnosphere is an information broker corporation that collects and sells information. This information can be broad market analysis or as specific as celebrity gossip. The Byrnosphere is rarely wrong and will mark information as 'probable' if there is any doubt to its validity. Gaia researchers are mostly AI Entities (with an AI Power of 6) but for difficult searches or human interest items, a human researcher will be brought in.

The Byrnosphere researchers are known for their tenacity for detail and accuracy of the data it collects. Their aim is not money or profit but the desire to find the answer to the question.

It is difficult to estimate how much a piece of data will be, most searches begin at 200 credits and then for each minute spent searching, another 50 credits is charged. This can get very expensive quickly, so ensure you set a limit before placing a search.

#### Byrnosphere Black Mills
For trusted repeat customers, Byrnosphere researchers have been known to hack into private Gaia volumes and steal data. Black Mill operations are adept at sifting information in the Undergaia (which is also illegal) to ensure that data is of the highest quality. 

Those Characters with Hacking can normally find a Byrnosphere researcher on the Undergaia.

### Burntek 
Burntek are a weapons manufacturer that enjoy their work as much as the users of Burntek weapons enjoy their products. Burntek weapons dance on the fine line between brilliance and lunacy, offering a mix of solid favourites and sheer madness. 

Burntek's public face is through a down-to-earth and forthright Marketing department who states clearly what their product is for: shredding things. Prices for Burntek weapons can be found in the Equipment Index.

#### Burntek Black Mills
Some of the more enterprising Burntek offices offer special 'upgrades', whose legality is questionable. For those with enough money, Burntek will offer just about any lethal device - custom made to the desired specifications.

### Endotek
Endotek fill the market for high specification spacecraft. Unlike Ariane, Endotek concentrate on the very best materials and designs, creating what they believe are works of art. Each craft is slightly different: built around a generic core but modified to suit the ideas of the 'artist' who finalises the design before build. No two Endotek spacecraft are the exactly same and are often referred to as having their own personality. 

#### Endotek Black Mills
When commissioning a new spacecraft construction, Endotek have been known to provide customisations not in line with the law. Illegal weapons (such as orbit to surface canons) and upgrades that evade Star Enforcer sensors can be found on Endotek craft.

### Forester
Forester are the largest and longest running Grav Car manufacturer. Approximately 70% of the Grav Cars driven are Forester based. Forester's brand is one of unexciting reliability and a starting point for a huge array of modification and upgrades. Few drive a factory standard Forester, most are slightly modified.

Forester's most popular Grav Car is the Anchorage, which combines style, low cost, family practicality and reliability. 

#### Forester Black Mills
Forester Black Mills have become something of an institution that skirt on the edge of legality. All Forester repair shops offer a range of upgrades to their vehicles. However, some of these upgrades are illegal copies of gadgets installed on competitor's vehicles. 

Forester Black Mills will also offer to repair damage (such as bullet holes) without asking any questions.

### Gaian - Gaia News
Gaian (Gaia News) is an independent non-Imperial news organisation that has a mandate from the people to ensure fair reporting throughout human occupied space and from within the Imperium. Gaian is viewed as a very serious news organisation and only reports on those stories that are worthy of public interest. It is funded from Imperial coffers and does not run any commercials. Gaian does not have any Black Mills.

#### Jurisdiction
Gaian are able to perform investigative journalism from within the Imperium and are able to request information up to the level of Admiral. Gaian are not allowed to report on private individuals and any internal corporate matters. Gaian journalists are often sent on Fleet missions across the Light Jump net to report on the war (or lack of it).

#### Intercluster and Colonial
Gaian can be viewed as two separate organisations. Intercluster are big stories that affect many systems over a huge area. The journalists working in Gaian Intercluster are exceptional, well known, well paid and well respected. 

Colonial news are those stories that matter to a single or small group of closely connected systems. Colonial news is often used as a disparaging term for news that is deemed to be less useful or of a lower quality. The journalists in Colonial news tend to be very well known locally but not elsewhere and are paid proportionately.

#### Accuracy and reliability
Gaian news is famous for its accuracy and reliability. The journalists report at the very highest standards and editorial policy is extremely strict. Any bribery or corruption is soon rooted out at the full weight of the law is thrown at them. If Gaian reports on a story, you can be sure that it is as accurate as can be - even if it points out inadequacies in the Imperium or local government. 

### Kanster
Kanster is a construction company that has a long and deep running connection with the Imperium. Kanster is responsible for the rapid construction of millions of colonies across Human Occupied Space. Kanster build Mex cities, Crofts, Orbitals and Orbs using Automatons and a human supervising crew.

Kanster perform very little repair of facilities - which is left to local firms to provide. Kanster is a nomadic company - their offices are based on huge hulking spacecraft that purchase raw materials locally and manufacture all the parts in situ. 

When a Kanster flotilla arrive in a system to perform a build, there is a breakneck pace of work that leaves people speechless. With raw materials at hand, they can build a fully functioning Orbital that can house 100 million people in under 20 days.

#### Kanster Black Mills
Kanster are so tightly tied to the Imperium that they do not have a Black Mill. Furthermore, there is little demand for illegal space stations.

### Moss
Moss is a personal armour and shields manufacturer. Best known for their ubiquitous environment suits, Moss have a broad catalogue from Grav Bike racer impact suits to heavy powered armour. Moss came was born of the flames of the Aran War in 37978 as an armour manufacturer for the Arans. At the end of the war, Moss began making environment suits - using their military based powered armour knowledge to build better and cheaper suits.

#### Moss Black Mills
Unofficially, Moss will create any powered armour suit you might want and will attach all manner of illegal technology to it. Moss has close ties to the Technomage Syndicate and rumours are common about the capabilities of some of the higher end suits. Some even claim that Moss have created suits that can light jump - a technology only available to Star Fleet.

### Napalm
Napalm are comfortably the human race's favourite weapon manufacturer. Known for reliability at a reasonable price, Napalm have an enviable position at the top. Napalm build the Arms series of low power weapons and Astraripper chain guns (intended for large humans or those with bionics). 

Napalm as a core company is surprisingly small, consisting of mostly research and development and marketing. The actual manufacturing of the weapons is out sourced to dedicated manufacturing companies.

#### Napalm Black Mills
Napalm's weapon smiths are and extremely creative and inventive group. Their Gaia based design offices are well known for being wacky homages to popular media, such as medieval Europe or galactic beauty spots. Some of the upgrade designs that leave the office are from the very edges of their fevered imaginations and they often break various laws. When the designs pop up on Undergaia, the only ways one can tell their origin is from the Napalm Black Mill is by the quality and tight fitting to existing Arms weapons.

### Poraq
Poraq make solid state generators, which are fitted in just about every device. Solid state generators are an old technology - that uses a fuel which is safe, clean and lasts for thousands of years. Poraq's generators meet the carefully craft Imperial laws that ensure that every generator is safe to use. With the onset of The Droid War, Poraq lost all of its competitors (who were based in Sectors that were taken by the Droids) and are now the de facto generator manufacturer. 

### Void Rescue
Void Rescue are a privately run emergency service that will come and rescue you if your spacecraft is stranded in space (or on planet surface). Void Rescue offer a number of packages that offer different levels of service. For a large extra fee, Void Rescue will also enter the Fringe or Droid Space to rescue you. Their spacecraft are always beautifully clean and are painted in bright yellow and black stripes (affectionately known as Void Bees).

#### Black Mills
Although clean and tidy in appearance, no Void Rescue crew is squeaky clean. For a price, they can be asked to turn a blind eye or not ask where the original crew of the spacecraft went!

### Zaxcann
Zaxcann are a premium weapon manufacturer, an offshoot of the Imperium's Star Scientifica. Since the outbreak of The Droid War, the Imperium have had a policy of arming the general public. The richer slices of society demand more high tech weapons and for those daring enough to cross the light jump net to face the Droids, weapons of considerable power. This is the gap that Zaxcann fits. Most Zaxcann weapons are intended for augmented humans.

#### Zaxcann Black Mills
Zaxcann's links with Star Scientifica are still strong and as such, a lot of secret technology filters into the public domain through Zaxcann. It's understood that designs for devastatingly powerful Ion weapons have appeared time to time.

## Syndicates
Where there is a system, there is always a group of people out to make gain by exploiting it or fighting it. As the Imperium becomes better at fighting crime, crime gets better at avoiding capture. At this advanced state of Law Enforcement, petty criminals have become a thing of the past.

The law cannot watch over all of the population all of the time and where criminals are discreet and intelligent, they can continue unmolested by the Star Enforcers. Most Syndicates fall on one side of the humanist, technologist philosophical divide. Many battles exist between these two groups purely on the basis of ideology.

None of these Syndicates are public knowledge. Information on them can be dug out of Gaia for the more persistent researcher but the details are likely to be vague or often biased heavily depending on the philosophy of the writer.

### Syndicate or Society?
The difference between a Syndicate (as given here) and a Society is that a Syndicate breaks laws. The Imperium has labelled these organisations as illegal and being a member can lead to arrest on conspiracy charges. Some of these organisations begin as a Society and then radical elements of the Society use the structure of the Society to commit crime. If the Star Enforcers can arrest and remove these people before the entire Society becomes rogue then the Society is not classified as a Syndicate.

### Contacting Syndicates
There are two main ways for characters to get in touch with Syndicates. The first and simplest way of contacting a Syndicate is using the Undergaia (see Undergaia on page 54). Information regarding the Syndicates can be found on the Undergaia but it's important to think laterally when doing so. Very little accurate information on Syndicates is actually stored on the Undergaia under the actual names of the Syndicates, so associated information is better to search for. 

> Example: The Technomages (listed below) might be better discovered by looking for independent inventors and their slightly illegal inventions.

The second method is to use contacts. The contacts might not be part of the Syndicate but could start a chain of contacts that lead to a member of a Syndicate. A recommendation from a friend is a sure-fire way of being contact.

> Example: A friendly NPC works at a local weapon smith and although he can't upgrade your weapon with illegal addons, we might know someone who can.

### Typical Criminal Activities
Each Syndicate has its own flavour of crime in line with the belief of its members, however there are generally illegal activities most get involved in:

- Protection rackets. Pay the gang a fee to avoid being beaten up.
- Loan sharking. Lending money and charging interest is illegal.
Selling stolen goods.
- Hacking corporate networks for secrets to sell to competitors.
- Smuggling people or items around the planet or off it.
- Unlicensed bionic augmentation. Or augmenting people who don't want to be!
- Rail Fighting to the death.
- Piracy.

### The Technomages
Philosophy: Technologist. Members: Over 10 billion. 
The Technomages aim to support home technologists and to aid the spread of learning in technology. Although these aims sound honourable, some of the technology which is supported is considered illegal by the Imperium. Their illegal interests also reach into handling of stolen goods, harbouring known criminals (especially other Technomages) and supplying equipment to known felonious groups (such as The Machine). Although massively Intersector, the majority of the ruling Mages are based in the Turus Cluster, which is home to the Star Fleet. The size and proliferation of science of the colony makes it the perfect hiding place.

What makes the Technomages unique is their standing with the Star Enforcers. Although they are a clandestine society, most of the Mages are good, law abiding, loyal citizens who have the Technomages as a source of job or hobby. The Star Enforcers mostly see them as a harmless organisation that would take a lot of effort to arrest without actually removing many criminals from the streets. 

From time to time, the Technomages can also act as a source of information for the Star Enforcers. If there is any group working against the colony, they often use their criminal contacts to find information that may lead to an arrest. This delicate situation is dependent on each System. On colonies where the Star Enforcer Colonials are lenient, they enjoy a peaceful life. On nearby Systems, things might not be so easy. This difference in Enforcer leniency leads to differing levels of secrecy. In some locations, Technomages may able to meet openly in a bar. Elsewhere, meetings are held quickly in darkened rooms underground.

The Technomages are not a group that are widely known by the public. News providers do not find much interest in geeks and so rarely report them. If the public were to find out that a special arrangement was held between the Star Enforcers and a clandestine group, a public demanded crackdown would fragment the Technomages and drive them under ground.

#### Organisation
The Technomages have a number of ranks which is shown as black bands around a blue strip of cloth called a 'Mobius'. Advancement comes through aiding others, creating innovative pieces of technology or by helping out non-Technomages gratis using technology. Joining the Technomages is by invitation only. The smallest unit of the Mages is a 'Cell' which consists of anything up to 50 people spread across an Orbital, Colony, System or Cluster. A cell works on a similar area of technology (such as Star Craft). 

Where there are many different cells in an area, they are grouped together called a Clan. A Clan usually consists of Cells with very different interests. The Cells within a Technomage Clan share knowledge and look after each other.

A Clan issues awards to their Mages in the form of decoration on their Mobius. Awards are gained when a Mage has excelled in their field by creating a piece of technology or research that furthers the knowledge of humanity. The promotions are shapes that signify different achievements in different Clans but are all celestial objects such as stars, planets, moons, nebulae, black holes etc. Promotion is awarded when the Technomage has an all round commitment by helping others and putting a lot into the Cell's community.  

#### Known Allies
- Crossed Arm
- The Machine

#### Rumours
The Technomages have been around for an extremely long time, their origins somewhat vague. One rumour is that the Star Sci set up the Technomages to better monitor and control the general public toying with technology. Star Sci are notoriously difficult to contact and have technology far in advance of anything in the public domain. Whether they have their scientists embedded in the Technomages remains a mystery.
Using the Technomages

The Technomages are everywhere and in heavily populated places, there can be thousands. They are useful for identifying unknown bits of technology, sourcing rare pieces of kit and getting hold of experimental systems. Cells where the topic of study gives rise to dangerous illegal technology will be more difficult to contact. High concentrations of Technomages will offset that difficulty.

The Technomages can be contacted through the usual channels of the Undergaia but it's also possible to meet them by attending local technology social gatherings, seminars and exhibitions. If you know to look for the blue bands, they can be found.

### Crossed Arm
Philosophy: Technologist. Members: Over 100 000. 
The Crossed Arm are the militant wing of the Technomages. They independent of the Technomages who have many connections with the Technomages. The Crossed Arm serve to keep the Technomages safe, protecting them from Humanity Syndicates but without Technomage mandate. They believe that the advancement of humankind is worth fighting for.

Unlike the Technomages, the Crossed Arm are hunted by the Star Enforcers as a matter of course. The Technomages do not have a good relationship with the Crossed Arm as many Mages feel that their methods are over the top and not appropriate for the essentially peaceful organisation. It's often the case that Technomages have denied knowledge of the Crossed Arm or even given information to the Star Enforcers, with a risk of incriminating themselves.

#### Organisation
The Crossed Arm is organised into Cells with little or no hierarchy above the Cell. A Cell tends to be created from an offshoot of another cell or from disgruntled Technomages who wish to perform their own justice.

### The Chrome
The Chrome believe that the next evolutionary step is not through natural selection but by the augmentation of the human body. They believe that to truly release the human mind to its full potential, it must be removed from the constraints of the human body and placed in a more capable frame. The Chrome argue that the human senses are not as evolved as the human mind and that it's wasteful to not provide the brain with all the sensory input that technology can provide. This hard-line belief in bionics is often in reaction to the general populace's mistrust persecution of those with bionics. The Chrome began by protecting those who had no choice but to turn to bionics, for example, those born with genetic defect. 

The majority of the Syndicate still operates by these philosophical principles but there is a hard core that takes the idea a step further. In extreme cases, people who have taken the choice to die (rather than accept bionic replacement body parts) are abducted and augmented against their will. In some cases, this is in the best interest for the individual,  such as if they had been paralysed from an early age and cannot communicate with the outside world. In those cases, it is up to the family to decide whether to augment. The Chrome would abduct to fit a Neural Rayengine Link (Rink) so that the paralysed individual can communicate with the outside world using Gaia.

The Chrome also fight for the rights of Borgs who are discriminated against on colonies where there is a large humanist element. A semi-legal offshoot of The Chrome is known as the 'Pro-Longevity' group, who argue for extending human life. The syndicate is funded by typical criminal operations, mostly theft and extortion.

#### Organisation
The Chrome are a disparate group who communicate and organise through the Undergraia. There is no form of overall hierarchy but there are wealthy individuals who fund and provide resources in each Sector of Human Occupied Space. It is believed that these people are responsible for the direction and the motivation of the The Chrome operatives who perform the functions of the Syndicate. The main investors of The Chrome are very difficult to track down (else the Star Enforcers would have arrested them under the Organised Crime laws).

#### Using The Chrome
The Chrome are often used to throw trouble into difficult situations. The player team might have a contact that goes missing and turns up a Borg three weeks later. The Chrome can also be used if a player Character wishes to get bionics without having to pay. The Chrome are not difficult to get in touch with using the Undergaia but it should be noted that it's more a case of them getting in touch with you than the other way around. 
If existing Borgs need upgrading or repair, the Chrome can come in very handy as well, where the Star Civilisation medical centres might ask why the Borg was damaged or needs upgrading, the Chrome-friendly medics would ask very little. Asking anything of the Chrome will put the requester in their back pocket and may be asked to do some unsavoury tasks in the future.

#### Allies

- Akarakian Exiles

### The Sun Children
The Sun Children believe that humanity should be at the centre of the concerns of a human race. Their chief drivers are life, compassion, love, nature, music and other romantic visions. As a philosophy, it is vague and harmless but it is in its application that it becomes an illegal problem. The Sun Children's ideal goal would be to return to Earth and live in harmony with the environment without the need of technology.

Externally, the Sun Children look like an organisation that should be open and without threat from the Imperium. Their philosophies are liberal and not violent. The closest approximation to the Sun Children are the prehistoric hippies of ancient Earth.

The Sun Children are not tolerant of the rest of society and their more active groups seek to bring down any technologist organisation (either Syndicate or Corporate). Small time operations include graffiti on the walls of an Automaton Factory and in the extreme, the destruction of an Orbital.
The Star Enforcers see the Sun Children as something of an annoyance - forming demonstrations, causing traffic jams and disrupting the creation of Mex cities but they do not pose much of a threat as violence is not in line with their core beliefs.

#### Organisation
The Sun Children are organised locally over Gaia. Most of the information about the Sun Children does not need to be obtained through the Undergaia because the Philosophies are not a troubling concern of the Imperium. The organisation of rallies, demonstrations and other peaceful, non-criminal acts are legal and can be easily accessed. There is no overall leader and companies based on Humanist leaning planets or that operate in a Humanist market (such as the natural food industry) openly give donations to good causes.

The illegal part of the Sun Children do their organisation on the Undergaia. The criminal elements are local group, intrusion from outsiders is treated with the upmost suspicion. Some of the illegal acts are funded by legitimate individuals or companies that wish to make money from the disruption caused to business. As the members of the Sun Children tend to be idealistic in their cause, they enjoy having their belief supported by someone appearing to share their passion - even if that person's true intentions are far from Humanistic.

#### Using the Sun Children
The Sun Children aren't difficult to find but the more useful, active part are. They can be operated on indirectly by publicising a 'technological injustice' or harm to the environment. If there are a number of pro active and illegal Sun Children cells on planet then they will soon make use of the public information.

### Su Chi
The Su Chi are a spin off Syndicate of the Sun Children (the named formed by shortening the name).  The Su Chi are Sun Children with an Akarakian twist. Although not directly affiliated with the Akarak Nation, they operate using a similar set of rules that the Akarakians do, called the 'Sun Codex'. The Su Chi began as extremists hippies who realised that to win the war, they needed to fight fire with fire. They embrace the 'evils' of technology so that they may fight against it. Where the Sun Children rarely wield firearms, the Su Chi are extremely well equipped.

The Su Chi work with the fringes of the Sun Children. Where the Sun Children have not managed to solve an injustice peacefully or without violence, the Su Chi will do whatever it takes to make the change. They believe that the future of the human race depends on these drastic actions. This is where a similarity with the Akarakian Nation is drawn and it is the only similarity.

The Sun Children publicly deny all connection with the Su Chi. The often dramatic and violent Su Chi actions are not always separated from the Sun Children in the minds of the general public and so violent actions will sour the Sun Children's reputation. In more secret circles, the Su Chi are seen as a necessary evil. Where the Sun Children find it difficult to make a stand, the Su Chi will have no problem. Thus, at the higher levels of the Sun Children, there are lots of links with Su Chi operatives.

The Su Chi perform all sorts of actions, from convincing a famous Automaton maker to retire; to murdering the head of a Colony's Council for allowing a new automated technology factory to be built.

It is the Su Chi that the Star Enforcers are particularly interested in and there are many arrests made. The zealous nature of the Su Chi often makes them sloppy - they care more for the future of the human race and its connection with nature than they do for their own well being.

#### Organisation
The Su Chi are organised into pairs (called Partnerships) throughout the galaxy. There is no hierarchy. Some Partnerships do communicate with each other but their meetings are not organised and they know little of other operations. In some cases, this lack of organisation means that two Partnerships work on solving the same problem and meet mid-mission. This can cause friction but the pairs normally become four to meet the objective.

When one of the Partnership dies, then it is the duty of the living remainder to recruit and train another two. The better trainee of the two is then sent off to find another partner and the less good trainee becomes a partner. In this way, the Su Chi maintain their numbers. Their ranks are normally recruited from the more extreme elements of the Sun Children.

#### Using the Su Chi
The Su Chi are quite easy to get in touch with through the Undergaia. They do not keep themselves too covert because they believe that the Sun Children need to be able to call upon them at any time. Although this makes life easier for the Star Enforcers, only a single Partnership is ever arrested.

Like most Syndicates, the Su Chi will normally only work for their own cause. If you can convince a Su Chi operative that someone needs to die because they have some connection with the decline of humanity through technology then you have a very cheap (often free) assassination service.

#### Allies
- Sun Children
- Nios

### Nios
Nios are the ubiquitous Humanist Syndicate. Not as old as the Sun Children but ten times more passionate and focused. Whereas the Sun Children hold generally romantic beliefs about nature, music and humanity, Nios believe that the human soul is being corrupted and that evolution has not been allowed to progress properly. Thus, Nios fight against human augmentation through bionics.

These beliefs are often taken to the extreme. In normal society, a newborn baby with severe lung defects would be immediately augmented so that they can lead a normal life but Nios would argue that this corrupts the baby's soul and would rather see the newborn die. Tied with this strict belief is a notion of destiny - if the child was meant to die then it should do so. Unlike ancient religions, this faith does not hinge upon the existence of a God but on the natural order of things.

Nios is more of an intellectual Syndicate than the Sun Children and its members often hold positions of responsibility across the Imperium and within colonies. The upshot of this is a number of laws restricting the scientific study that Star Sci is allowed to perform. One good example is that the genetic modification of humanity is illegal, even if it might lead to the cure of a disease. Nios see this as the most dangerous step humanity could take. Nios constantly work towards making all augmentation illegal although this is likely to be something of an impossible struggle.

#### From Society to Syndicate
Nios went from being an intellectual society to an illegal Syndicate when extremely high levels of criminal activity and corruption was discovered. The structure of the society was being used to pervert the cause of justice, warp business practises, fix elections, stunt colonial growth, blackmail technologist individuals, perform industrial espionage, hacking and defrauding organisations. 

When a huge body of evidence was released onto the public domain by Star Civilisation, the majority of law abiding members left the organisation, leaving only the criminal core. This core went underground.

#### Organisation
Nios is organised in a tree structure, with autonomous groups called Branches. At the top are the wealthy who fund Nios (through fraud, embezzlement, bribes and donations) and give the Branch some direction. At the bottom of the hierarchy are many operatives who perform the more manual tasks within the Organisation. Money is passed down through the tree to the roots, where keen operatives can  fund their anti-technology projects.

A Branch's size depends on where it is located. A single Branch usually covers a Cluster of systems but a few larger Branches cover up to five Clusters. By being distributed across many systems, the Star Enforcers have more difficulty in tracking and arresting the operatives.

#### Using Nios
Nios are difficult to contact through the Undergaia because they are very wary of the Star Enforcers infiltrating their organisation. If a player group does make contact, then it is likely to be someone half way up the Branch, with people below and above them. 

As Nios members are typically suspicious and intelligent, it can be difficult to convince them to perform any actions. However, Nios will trade information in their interest. Furthermore, their attentions can be diverted for the right sum of credits. If you own a technological factory and you're worried it might be destroyed by Nios then you can always pay them to divert their attentions elsewhere.

#### Allies

- However, not the Raised Fist

### The Raised Fist
The Raised Fist are a radical militant offshoot of Nios. Known for being perhaps the most violent of all the Syndicates, The Raised Fist actively seek to destroy and harm anyone who has corrupted a human soul. Whereas Nios are subtle and try to perform their actions without the knowledge of the Star Enforcers, The Raised Fist are brutal, open and blatant. The ideals of Nios and The Raised Fist are so very similar that they are often mistaken for each other. This adds to the bitter tension between the two Syndicates.

The Raised Fist will murder, destroy, poison, burn and tear down any edifice that might be connected with the corruption of the human soul. In particular, human bionics implant shops are a favourite target. They will also seek to kill anyone who has had their soul corrupted. They refer to this as 'releasing' that person because in death, the soul is allowed to escape the technological body. Most bionics The Raised Fist attack tend to be well armoured, therefore The Raised Fist are normally well armed. Of all the Syndicates, this is the one that gives the Star Enforcers most trouble.

Recruitment often occurs from disgruntled members of Nios who would prefer to take more action. Nios zealots are head hunted by The Raised Fist and quickly trained.

#### Organisation
The Raised Fist are organised much like Nios, with Branches spanning clusters. However, the lowest levels are group into Murder Squads. An Murder Squad, as the name suggests, is a group of operatives who are trained in slightly different areas so to make a more effective team. The size of a Murder ranges between 3 and 9, depending on their level of funding and density of Star Enforcers.

It is uncertain who funds The Raised Fist as those at the top of the hierarchy are unknown. There is very little structure between those with the money and power and the Murder Squads. Rumours have been spread that the higher powers of Nios are the very same as in The Raised Fist but this connection is impossible to prove.

#### Using The Raised Fist
It is astronomically difficult to use The Raised Fist. They operate solely on their own agenda. If a Murder Squad appears to be doing your bidding, it is because their masters share the same goals. They cannot be bought off, nor can they be distracted. The Undergaia can be used to find nearby Murder Squads but contact is rare.

#### Allies
- None.

### The Machine
The Machine are a technologist syndicate who believe that Automatons of a certain intelligence are sentient beings that should have the same rights as humans. The Machine support any of the Technologist Syndicates and actively fight against Humanist ones.

The Machine help Automatons that are ascending. In systems where ascension is a problem, the Machine will buy the Automatons and move them to a colony where their ascension can be fostered. This is the pleasant side of the Machine. Where an Automaton cannot be simply purchased, the owner will be forced to give it up - often under severe duress. Where Automatons have been abused, then The Machine will abuse the owner in the same manner.

#### Organisation
The Machine is organised on the Undergaia across a huge number of volumes. Information regarding Automaton abuses are fed in and action is decided upon. There are plenty members of the public who adopt Automatons and fund The Machine. It is believed that a few stand at the head of the organisation and provide its direction but those reports are difficult to confirm.

#### Using the Machine
The Machine are a useful syndicate to know as they can be used to cause havoc in Humanist locations. The Machine jump on any chance to give a human their comeuppance.

#### Allies
- Any Technology based syndicate: The Technomages, Crossed Arm and The Chrome.

### The Silver Blade
The Silver Blade is a Syndicate that acts as a support group and employment agency for assassins. The Silver Blade does not have a humanist or technological lean. They work to a set of rules for credits, regardless where the credits came from. Each assassin in the Silver Blade must adhere to the rules, even though the methods of assassination are varied. The Silver Blade is used by all the other Syndicates as well as rich private individuals with a score to settle.

The main rules (there are hundreds in total) of the Silver Blade are:

1. Half the payment is to be provided before, half after.
2. Discretion at all times.
3. Never admit to being a member of the Silver Blade.
4. If the task cannot be performed in the given time, then the money must be returned in full.
These rules have kept the integrity of the Silver Blade over many centuries.

#### Organisation
The Silver Blade is a flat organisation, there is no hierarchy. A series of intelligent, free-roaming Gaia entities perform the function of connecting clients with a suitable assassins. Each assassin pays a monthly fee to be a member and this pays for the creation of new Gaia entities when the Star Enforcers kill existing ones. Assassins wishing to join the Silver Blade must perform a series of jobs at a much reduced pay. Once joined, the Silver Blade member will be recognised on Gaia as a member and can be contacted for work.

#### Using the Silver Blade
The Silver Blade can be tricky to contact on the Undergaia (Taxing difficulty) and a new contact is required for each job that is needed. However, the Silver Blade are remarkably reliable and operate throughout Imperium Space. All this quality comes at a price. The more difficult the target, the more you pay. For an average member of the public, the price is approximately 8 000 and for a colony councillor, the price is nearer 100 000.

#### Allies
- Everyone and no-one.

### Tortrac Heds
The Tortrac Heds (or simply Heds) are a 'general troubleshooting' Syndicate. Their services include finding, stealing, killing, repairing, defending, hacking, partying, intimidating or doing any odd-job that you need. Their most distinguishing feature is that they are not reliable. Akin to the anarchistic Punks of the ancient 20th Century, the Heds are hell-bent on hedonism and bucking the 'system' (which is not always the Imperium). If you were to ask the Heds to retrieve an Akarakian sword, for example, they might well collect it before returning it to you, blade first.

Part of the Heds' charm is their drug fuelled energy.  When the Heds work for someone, they really go to work for them, with an energy and gusto you'd expect from children. However, much like children, they lose interest if the job takes an extended period of time so it is best to use the Heds for short and fun missions with plenty of room for error.

Although outrageous and flamboyant, they are also very good at resisting arrest. They can reign chaos onto a system and leave very little hard evidence that is was them. They operate fast and effectively, and rarely return to the same colony twice.

#### Organisation
The Heds group themselves into Gangs of between 10 and 50 Heds. A Gang nearly always operates from a spacecraft (if they lose it, they normally steal a new one). There is no organising body, Gangs will call themselves Heds as a way of demonstrating their mode of operation. Each Gang has a Governor who is Captain of the ship and arranges the work. It is through common interest and the Undergaia that these disparate groups are connected together as a single Syndicate. 

Each Gang is extremely competitive and they like to show off the tasks they perform, how close they got to the Star Enforcers without being arrested and how much money they earn. Throughout the Undergaia, there are unofficial lists of the best Gangs. The Gangs will support each other against a common enemy: one of the other Syndicates, the Imperium or a client who doesn't pay.

#### Using the Tortrac Heds
The Heds can appear elusive (they certainly are to the Star Enforcers) but they can be found on the Undergaia with a trained eye. Each Gang leaves Undergaia graffiti on the walls of Undergaia forums suggesting ways to contact them along with some marketing message regarding their unorthodox methods.

Contact is made through the Governor. They always ask for payment in full up front as they often have to disappear quickly into the void of space afterwards. The Heds are best used for actions that are not precise and incisive. The Heds often take payment in something other than cash.

#### Allies
- The Heds are rarely used by the other Syndicates.

## Recreation
One quarter of people's lives is spent in recreational pursuits. There is a huge number of different hobbies that people engage in from supporting a Planetball team to building gliders to glide above thermal vents. This section details a few of the more conventional ways of spending spare time.

### Physical Socialising
Still the most popular of all past times is having fun with friends. Physical Socialising (or 'In Fizz') is where people meet in the real world to listen to music, dance, chat, drink alcohol and take legal drugs. Each established Mex colony boasts a huge number of bars and clubs. Each bar and club is often run by Automatons, who can work around the 40 hour cycle. The Automaton personalities are chosen to fit the atmosphere the owner of the club or bar desires. This can range from rude through to submissive. 

Food and drink is ordered using Gaia menus that appear as colourful floating Hard Light holograms. It is served by either an Automaton or a simple hovering, self-propelling tray. In exclusive and expensive places, humans serve the food and drink.
Live music is rare in these clubs and bars, normally the musicians are on a far away system. They appear amongst the crowd as a hard-light projection, even though their physical body is light years away in a holoroom.

A large, flat area of the club or bar is normally reserved for dancing. In this area, people wriggle, step and gesticulate in time with the music while holographic shapes swim and burst around them. Those who take dancing more seriously have their own holographic shapes that move and shimmer in line with the dance moves of the owner. In this way, the owner controls the shapes and can create their own show.

In Fizz is preferable by most because it is possible to find and meet a sexual partner. This is partly possible in Gaia but procreation and the exchange of bodily fluids is not possible.

### Gaia Socialising
The next best form of socialising is within Gaia. This is almost identical to In Fizz socialising except that it is the Gaia Isis that actual does the contacting. Isis are idealised avatars of the people they represent, so Gaia tends to be filled with a disproportionately large number of attractive and well groomed people. Gaia Socialising is ideal for those who wish to meet people without physically leaving their home. People on spacecraft thousands of light years from any world can still keep in touch with people from their home planet.

More high tech Gaia rooms have an in-built Bioreorganiser that can make any food stuff (given the right entity to make it). Anyone using a high tech room like this can order food from their preferred restaurant and it will be made locally, wherever they are. 

### The Crossover
There is a crossover between In Fizz and In Gaia socialising. These are bars that are large Gaia holorooms (most are anyway) that allow Gaia Isis to mix with real people. These Crossover bars and clubs are popular to some but to many they are confusing because it is not obvious whether the person you are talking to is real or sitting on a spacecraft far away human occupied space. The only way for the real person to tell is to try and get the other person to leave the confines of the bar or club. If they are using Gaia, then they cannot leave.

### Gaia Alternaties
A Gaia Alternatity is an alternate world that persists somewhere in Gaia. Think of it as a virtual world game where people can play Characters in a different world. These worlds are very popular amongst those who wish to escape from their lives. Gaia Alternaties are often set in fantastic worlds or historical times.

### Gaia Interactives
A Gaia Interactive is a partially interactive story where the viewer can sit and watch the story as the creator intended or have an input into the events of the story to change its direction. Cheap Interactives are easy to come by but the number of choices available are few. More complex interactives have intelligent Gaia entities that respond more believably to events.

### Planetball
Planetball is a team sport that involves scoring goals by placing a ball through a hoop. The hoops are mounted on vehicles and both teams start on opposite sides of a planetoid.  A single Planetball game is normally played over a number of days and in that time, it can be possible to score 10 goals. 

Each team is equipped with a number of vehicles that the players can use to transport themselves and the ball. When players from opposing teams meet, there is normally a large amount of exciting inter-vehicle combat. The only weapon that is allowed in Planetball is the Ballgun, a device that can be used to propel the ball up to 1km. The ball itself is only 30cm across and made from a polyceramic material. It also has a Grav engine inside to allow it to propel itself depending on the spin and thrust the throwing player gives it. 

The Goal is usually mounted on the back of a Hauler and it is within that Hauler that the co-ordination of the team is performed.

Planetball teams have huge followings across Human Occupied Space and there are thousands of leagues, each containing hundreds of teams. In the top league are corporate and Imperial-sponsored teams with each of the Imperial Star Industries having a team (Star Fleet, Star Enforcers, Star Scientifica and Star Civilisation).

Although physically quite violent, in that players often get mangled in a high-speed accident, it is enjoyed by all ages - especially the top league where deaths are rare because the players are augmented.

There is big business in betting on Planetball leagues and merchandising.

### Rail Fighting
Rail Fighting is a blood sport whose rules vary depending on legality and location. Most colonies do not permit Rail Fighting but others actively encourage it, offering people a Gaia seat - for a fee (100 credits). Rail Fighting's roots is in boxing where two people are set against each other in a ring. In Rail Fighting, combatants fight in a circular room (normally with transparent walls). Around the edge is a rail 1.5 metres up from the floor. The combatants fight until one of them is unconscious or one hits the rail (either intentionally or not). 

From this basic set of rules, the deviations modify the format. Each modification has been given a name so that potential viewers know what to expect.

#### Full Blood
Notably played in the Tef Cluster in Dorian, the Full Blood version is a deadly version of the game. Each combatant is fitted with a health monitor that can sense death. Rather than unconsciousness, it is death that ends the fight. Weapons are often given to one or both of the combatants and the Rail around the edge cannot be used within the first 5 minutes of the game. This is the version that has given the sport its notoriety.
