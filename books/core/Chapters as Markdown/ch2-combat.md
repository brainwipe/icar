# The Core Mechanic
When you want your character to do an action that requires some skill, you will roll a die to decide if you pass or fail. This is called the core mechanic. 

It works like this:

> Skill + Attribute + Bonuses + D10 must be equal to or larger than Difficulty.

The gamesmaster will begin by setting the difficulty (see the table below) and then asking for a particular skill. The default difficulty is 12. The player will then suggest an attribute to use and remind the gamesmaster of any equipment they are using to help with a bonus. The player then rolls a D10 and the total is compared to a target number; meeting or exceeding the target number is a pass!

If the player doesn't have a Skill then that's OK, just use the Attribute and D10.

> Example: John Smith wants to prise open an airlock into a wreck. The GM says that there is no power to the door, so the target number is 12 and Macro Engineering skill, John has a 4 in Macro Engineering. John's player asks to use the Wit Attribute (4) and a Tech Kit (1). The GM agrees. John's player rolls a D10, gets a 5. His total is 14 (4 + 4 + 1 + 5), which is more than 12, so a pass. The airlock vibrates and grinds open.

> Example: John Smith wants to force open a space crate festooned with holographic warning stickers. The GM says that the target number is 12 and skill required is Hacking, which John has 1 in. John's player is going carefully, so uses his Wit Attribute (4). John's player rolls a D10 and gets a 6, which gives a total of 11 (4 + 1 + 6), which is a fail. Something inside the crate wakes up.

> Example: John Smith is desperately trying to restart the engines of the Orbihaul in a panic to escape a monster robot that has just burst from a crate. The GM says that the panic is making the task harder and sets the target number to 14, the skill required is Macro Engineering (4). John's player wants to use Wit but the GM says that everyone is panicking so he must choose another. John Smith's player chooses to hammer the engine with brute force, and use the Meat attribute (2) with a wrench from his Tech Kit to help (1). John's player rolls a 7, giving a total of 14 (4 + 2 + 1 + 7), which is a pass (only just!). The engine blinks and roars into life, the Orbihaul tears away from the doomed wreck.

## Setting the Target Number
The GM gets to choose the target number depending on how difficult the action is.

_Difficulty Level Table_

| Difficulty | Number |
|------------|--------|
| Easy	| 10 |
| Normal | 12 |
| Hard | 16 |
| Impossible! | 22 |

## Critical Failure and Success
On a roll of 1, the character always fails. On a roll of 10, they always pass. These are called criticals and when they happen then the players get to decide what happens. In failure then it should be the worst possible outcome. Successes can be narrated by the winning player, failures narrated by the gamesmaster. Other players are encouraged to offer ideas about how the critical fail occurs. Fun or humorous ideas should be rewarded with roleplaying points.

## Optional: The Shared Dice Pool
At the start of the game, put a pot or hat in the middle of the table with a number of D10s equal to the number of players. When the players roll a D10, they can choose to pick a die from the hat to add to their total. The player can choose to keep doing this until the dice run out.

Any remaining dice at the end of the game get turned into roleplaying points, shared out between the players. This makes the game a little easier but adds an element of co-operation for the players. It's especially useful when you have less than 4 players.

# Combat
There are four types of combat in Icar: Close Combat (hand-to-hand), Fire Fighting (ranged weapons), Vehicle combat and Space combat. Initiative is used to determine who goes first and then players take turns. 

For all of these combat types, distance is measured by metres. This is used for ranges and movement rates. Time is split into Turns. Each turn is 3 seconds and a player may make spend that turn doing whatever action they like (providing it is possible). 

> Example: John Smith wins the initiative, draws his weapon first, rolls dice first and splatters the adversary's right arm all over the wall. The adversary doesn't get to shoot and has one glove too many.

## Turn Actions
A Turn is three seconds. In some cases, a character can do many different quick tasks in this time. Here is a list of actions which can be performed in a turn.

_Turn Action Table_                     

| Action                    | Effect                                            |                         
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|   
| Move                      | Move up to 4 times your Shift Attribute in metres.|
| Change Magazine           | Put a new Magazine into a weapon. |
| Change Weapon             | Select a new weapon and stow previous weapon. | 
| Recover Stun              | A Character will recover 10 Stun points if the Character remains inactive. |
| Get into / out of vehicle | As suggested. | 
| Say one thing             | Along with an action, a Character may utter one thing. | 
| Turn on shield            | Free! Does not take a turn but a shield can be raised in a turn. | 
| Use Close Combat Combo    | Execute a close combat combo against one or more opponents. | 
| Fire weapon               | Fire your weapon! | 

## Entering Combat
When a combat begins, the gamesmaster will follow these steps:

1. State that combat has started. Announce the start of the combat turn. Make sure all players are aware that combat has begun, otherwise they may be in a vulnerable state.
2. Describe where everyone and everything is. This allows each player to be certain of what situation their Character is in. You might like to draw crosses on the map to show where you are.
3. Roll for initiative. This gives an order of play. Initiative = Shift + Battle + D10.
4. Players take turns. Highest initiative goes first.

## The Turn Sequence
There are different turn sequences for each type of combat.  Once a combat sequence is complete, the gamesmaster will announce that the combat turn is over. 

## Healing
If you can step out of the fight, spend a moment shaking the haze away then you regain 1 stun per turn. A successful Medicine skill check with a Medkit hypo can bring you back to half your maximum stun.

Healing without being treated by a medic is slow. You must be resting to regain 1 hit point a day. Your character can still perform actions as long as they are not physically or mentally tiring.

A medic can heal hit points up to their skill in Medicine once a day. Medic kits give a better chance of success. A fully equipped medical facility can heal _at least_ an extra 10 per day.

### When you run out of Stun or Hit Points
When your Stun is 0 then you are unconscious. Your Stun can go below 0, which means that you will be asleep for that many turns.

When your hit points hit 0 then you have 2 minutes to live. As long as your brain is intact you can be saved. If you're vaporised, you're just dead. Within those 2 minutes, a successful Medicine skill check can stabilise you but that can only be tried 10 times.

### Bits blown off 
If the narrative demands that parts of the body are destroyed beyond repair then you must seek bionics. Organs can be regrown but whole limbs cannot. See the bionics section for more details.

### Star Civilisation Medical AI
Star Civilisation have a medical Artificial Intelligence that can help over Gaia. The service is free to use and gives +2 on a Medicine related skill roll (including the bionics ones). See Star Civilisation Healthcare XXXXXXX.

## Shields
Shields are an energy field that drains the energy from things hitting it. It only stops high energy objects.

A shield has Hit Points, which is the damage it can stop in a single combat turn. At the start of the next turn, its Hit Points return. If a shield takes more damage than it has hit points in a single turn then it shuts down at the end of the turn, taking all the damage that hits it. While a shield is on, no damage hits the user. 

A shut down shield can only be restarted after 60 seconds and with a Micro Engineering skill check.
Bigger shield systems can have multiple shields. This means that when one shield goes down, another shield pops up in its place immediately. 

# Close Combat
When you're near enough to smell their fear, that's Close Combat. You can always hit someone once in a turn like any other action but it's more fun to chain moves together in a combo. By default you use the Battle attribute with your skill check but that's negotiable, depending on the situation.

## Hitting once
To hit another character once: perform a Skill check using Street Fighting and Battle. If you surprise the enemy then the target number is 12. If they know you're coming then the highest roll wins. The loser loses stun, the amount being the winner's Meat attribute. 

> Without warning, Byrnie punches Simon squarely in the face. The GM gives a difficulty of 12 and set the skill as Street Fighting. Byrnie has a Street Fighting of 1 and a Battle attribute of 3. He rolls a D10, gets a 9, giving a total of 13 (1 + 3). This is more than 12 so he hits Simon. He is not carrying any weapons so Simon takes 3 stun (which is Byrnie's Meat attribute).

> In the next round, Byrnie and Simon try and hit each other at the same time. They are not using Combos, just bashing each other. They're now in a proper fight, so they are going to roll against each other. Byrnie rolls 5, giving him a total of 9 (5 + 3 + 1) Simon's Battle attribute is 4, Street Fighting is 2 and he rolls 4, giving him a total of 10 (2 + 4 + 4). Simon wins so Byrnie must remove stun equal to Simon's Meat attribute, which is 4 points.

If you are holding just about anything and want to hit someone once then perform a Street Fighting and Battle skill check and do Meat damage and Meat stun.

> Later Simon sneaks up behind Byrnie with a table leg and hits him over the back of the head. Simon's Battle attribute is 4 and Street Fighting is 2. He needs a 12 to hit Byrnie and rolls 6. His total is 12 (6 + 4 + 2) so he hits Byrnie. Byrnie removes 4 stun (Simon's Meat attribute) and because Simon is holding a table leg, he removes 4 hit points too. The Gamesmaster tells Byrnie that he's bleeding from a nasty gash on his head.

## Combos
A combo is a series of moves that your character can perform in a single turn flow such as Headbutt, Punch, Trip, Stamp. If you have the Street Fighting skill of 1 or higher then you can spend roleplaying points to build combos. A combo does damage and stun and has a difficulty. The more damage and stun your combo does, the more difficult it will be to execute. Some moves can have extra benefits, such as knocking the weapon from the other's hand. 

### Using a Combo
When it comes to your turn, you choose one of your combos from your list of combos. *You must verbally describe your combo before rolling a die*. If you forget, the combo fails automatically. Then roll a skill check using Street Fighting and Battle and subtracting the combo difficulty. The enemy you are fighting removes the combo's damage from their hit points and the stun from their stun.

 The default target number for NPCs is 10.

> Battle + Street Fighting - Difficulty + D10 = 10 or more.

> 'I'm going to hit the Star Enforcer with combo 1: punch, trip, stamp. Difficulty is 1.' said Byrnie and rolls the D10. Although he rolls a 10, he loses the round because there was no description first.

> 'I am going use kick the Star Enforcer in the groin, then I'm going to push him over the fence to trip, jump over myself and stamp on his face.'. combo #1, which is Punch, Trip, Stamp and has a difficulty of 2.

## Using a Combo Against Another Player Character
If two player characters are fighting, or perhaps a player character is fighting an NPC important enough to have their own combos, then the winner is the character with the highest score. Critical pass (rolling 10) or fail (rolling 1) are automatic success or failure. The the totals are equal then roll again. Roll initiative to find out who chooses their combo first; lowest chooses and narrates their combo first.

> 'While running, I'm going to barge into Simon and stamp on his groin twice. Using Combo 2, difficulty 2.' said Byrn.
> 'Seeing him come in, I'm going to bring him to a halt by headbutting three times. Using Combo 3, difficulty 3.' said Simon.
> Byrn and Simon roll D10s, Byrn's rolls 5, his total is 7 (1 + 3 - 2 + 5). Simon rolls 3, his total is 6 (2 + 4 - 3 + 3).
> Byrn's narration wins and Simon is left on the floor!

## Trip and Hold
Trip makes an enemy prone (lying on the floor). In the next round, the enemy must make a Street Fighting with shift opposed skill check (or use the Spring to Feet swap move). 'Hold' means the enemy cannot move until their break free using Street Fighting and Meat. You can Combo against the foe who is prone or held, if they pass their standing up or breaking free check then your Combo will fail.

To struggle free from a Trip and a Hold (being pinned down on the ground) then you must roll a Hard difficulty Street Fighting skill check with Meat or Shift.

## Swapping out Attributes
The attribute you use can be negotiated with the GM before the dice are rolled. Any attribute can be married with a fighting skill if the player is persuasive enough. In the example above, Simon could have used his Shift attribute of 4 because headbutting someone running at you is more a matter of dexterity than fighting prowess.

## Using Weapons in Combos
To use a weapon in a combo you need to have a good enough skill. For hand weapons, you need Street Fighting at level 2 and higher. For using a firearm (pistol, rifle or sub-machine gun) in close quarters then you need Gun Fu at level 1. The damage and stun you do is listed on the weapon if you're firing it. If you're using it as a blunt object to bash someone, then use the Meat of the character.

## Humans versus Augs
Humans are puny compared to those with bionic augmentation (Augs). Augs can choose to do damage with their Combos, the damage being the same as the stun. As Augs have a higher Meat attribute, they do more damage, have moresStun and regain stun quicker. Humans should avoid getting into a fight with an Aug at all costs. The same can be said for fighting with people in powered armour and insane automatons.

> EXAMPLE! XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX NEEDS BIONICS FIRST

## Using Advanced Close Combat Skills
Street Fighting covers the majority of fighting scenarios but there is also Gun Fu (close quarters gun play) and Akarak Art (like martial arts but much tougher). No matter where the moves come from, you always use your Street Fighting skill.

## Swap Moves
As you improve in the close combat skills of Street Fighting, Gun Fu and Akarak Art, you get the ability to improvise by swapping out moves in your Combo. Swap moves are only for that one use and have a difficulty. Add the swap move difficulty on top of the existing Combo difficulty, even though you are replacing one of your moves. You can only swap one move in a turn (until you reach Akarak Art at level 3). You can build swap moves in a Combo normally if you wish. 

The simplest swap that anyone can do is a Hold (requires Street Fighting level 1).

> Simon wants to headbutt Byrnie three times again. Byrnie is fed up with Simon headbutting him. Byrnie takes his Punch, Trip, Stamp combo and replaces Trip with Hold and says 'I want to punch him in the face and then as he's reeling, grab him round the shoulders.' The Stamp move won't happen because Hold ends the Combo. Hold has a difficulty of 1 added to the Combo's difficulty of 2. Byrnie rolls a D10 and gets an 8, his total is 9 (1 + 3 - 3 + 8). This beats Simon's roll. Simon will need to pass an opposed Meat check next turn to break free.

Combos and swap moves can become quite complex and specific to a situation. When a player chooses their swap moves, they are responsible for understanding what they are going to say in the narrative. If they cannot describe it in a way that others can understand then they cannot use it.

> Take the Gun Fu based Combo: Puppet, Reload, Reverse, Dismantle has the narrative 'Grab hold of the enemy with a gun and shoot their friend with it, reload it, shoot them with it and then dismantle it.' This means that the weapon will have fired twice in a single turn but it's an expensive Combo, so let the player enjoy it if they pass!

## How to Build a Combo
First you need to know what you want to achieve from your Combo in terms of difficulty, or achieving a goal. For example, you might start with an easy Combo that just punches someone as many times as you can (which is free!). You might also have one that leaves the opponent prone.

To build the Combo, choose the moves from the Combo table below, adding up Stun, Damage and Difficulty. You can have as many moves in your Combo as your Battle attribute. Each move has a skill requirement (except punch). Use Roleplaying Points to buy the Combo, the cost is the same as its difficulty.
Put your completed Combo on the front page of your character sheet with the Stun, Damage and Difficulty. You can have 6 Combos. If you run out of room and want to replace a Combo then you can but you can't edit a Combo that's already there.

## Pre-Built Example Combos
The Combos below are designed for a Battle attribute of 3 and Street Fighting and Gun Fu of 5.

- 'I'm going to barge him over and stamp on his head twice.' Leaves the enemy prone. Trip, Stamp, Stamp. Difficulty: 1. Stun: Meat x 2. Damage: 0. 
- 'I'm going to get really close, headbutt him, knee him in the groin and then uppercut into his face.' Headbutt, Kick, Punch. Difficulty: 2. Stun: Meat x 3. Damage: Meat. Good for starting fights.
- 'I'm going to kick him back up to the table, push him over it and as he tumbles onto the floor slam my heel into his chest.' Kick, Trip, Stamp. Difficulty: 2. Stun: Meat x 3. Damage: 0. Great for a bar fight.
- 'I'm going to pick up the leg from the broken table and keep hitting him while screaming.' Strike, Strike, Strike. Difficulty: 3. Stun: Meat x 3. Damage: Meat x 3.

## Fighting More Than One Foe
If you want to fight two people then pick a Combo for each foe (it can be the same for each) and roll a skill check with a -2 difficulty for each additional foe. Two foes -2, three foes -4, four foes -6 and so on.

> Byrnie has won the initiative against Simon and Gideon. 'I'm going to kick Simon in the groin and then the face (Kick, Kick) and I'm going to reach out and punch Gideon in the stomach and face twice (Punch, Punch).' Byrnie will need to roll once for each Combo add an extra -2 difficulty onto each roll.

## Close Combat Skills
These skills can be raised just like any other skill.

Level 1: Knock out
Level 2: Push Clear
Level 3: Improvise
Level 4: Undress, The Flow

> MOVES TABLE

# Firefighting
Fire fighting deals with ranged combat and firearms. It is assumed that all fire fights happen simultaneously and initiative is merely used to allow the more combat aware to see what happens to everything else before making their decision.

## Firearms
In Icar, weapons are not written down on part of the Character sheet but are included as handouts (folded paper into cards) and then kept with the Character sheet. This removes confusion about what the character is carrying. If the player does not have the sheet, they do not have the weapon. On the next page is the Nelson H1 from the Equipment Index, please refer to this as an example. You can download the handouts in the Equipment Index and print as needed.

> PICTURE OF NELSON

For quick reference, a list of weapons with their pictures is included in the technology section of this book but it is highly recommended to use the hand-outs as they contain more information about the weapon and extra features.

### Photo and Name
The picture shows a representation of the weapon with its name. The picture isn't upside down! Once you've folded the weapon sheet, it will be the correct way up.

### Features
The weapon's features are statistics that are used outside of combat. They are:

1. Cost. If bought new from a regular dealer.
1. Type of weapon. Gives you a sense of what it is best used for.
1. Rarity. This is a target number for a Street Deal skill check, lower is better.
1. Additional Features. These are accompanied with a heading and a description. Things such as 'Grav Balancing 'are additional features. For descriptions of what these technologies mean, see the Technology section of this book.
1. Stock Options. Some weapons are so versatile that the manufacturer may create them with possible additions straight from the factory. These come with a tick box, a price and a Rarity.

### Note
Either used for further pictures or options or for a brief history and description for the weapon.

### Statistics
The weapon's statistics are:
- Damage: how many hit points the weapon removes from the enemy.
- Magazine: how many shots you get before you must reload.
- To hit modifier: Added to your skill roll. 

## The Turn Sequence

### Begin Fire Fight
Fire Fight combat is entered into if the combatants fire weapons. The GM must state what targets there are, at what range they are and whether they are moving or in cover.

### Roll Initiative
Each combatant, whether they be NPC or player, rolls for initiative:

> Initiative = Battle + Shift + D10

The lower initiative, is the worse combatant and thus must decide what to do first, without having seen the outcome of everyone else's actions. 

### State Target and Roll
This is performed as a skill check. The player (or NPC) states the weapon she is using and the target she is shooting at. The gamesmaster sets the skill (usually Shooting) and a target number based on the situation (range, whether people are moving, the environment and so on). The attribute is usually Battle but the player may negotiate like any other skill check before adding on the weapon's To Hit modifier. If you hit, the target takes the damage from the gun.

> Skill + Attribute + Weapon To Hit Modifier + D10 must be equal to or larger than target number.

> Simon is sitting drinking Byrnie's beer. Byrnie's bursts in, his sense of humour fails and draws an Arms 3 sub-machine gun. He tells the GM he is shooting Simon with it. Simon is sitting nearby, so the GM decided that the difficulty is easy and sets a skill of Shooting and target number of 10. Byrnie is happy to use the Battle attribute, the Arms 3 to hit modifier is -1. Byrnie has a Battle of 3 and a Shooting of 3. He rolls a 5 giving 10 (3 + 3 - 1 + 5), which is only just a hit. Simon takes 20 damage and 20 stun, thrown from his chair.

### Example Difficulty Chart

# Vehicle Combat
In Icar all cars fly. This makes vehicle combat somewhere between great car chases and dog fights. Everyone in the vehicle can help in the combat and take on a role.

The pilot dodges, rams, speeds and gets into good firing positions, gunners use mounted or hand-held weapons, engineers adjust the setup of the vehicle to fit the situation and hackers throw chaos in the path. You don't need all of these roles to do vehicle combat.

## Roles

### Pilot  
*Skill: Pilot Grav, Target Number 12*
By manoeuvring the vehicle, the pilot aims to meet the goal of the team as a whole. The pilot has the final say because they are at the controls. The goals are:

- **Escape:** only possible if the escaping vehicle is faster.
- **Get into a firing position:** Gives a +2 to the Gunner's Shooting skill check.
- **Ram:** smashing into the enemy vehicle or pushing them into the floor, a building or another vehicle. Also makes jumping from one vehicle to another normal difficulty (target number 12). Each vehicle takes damage that's 10% of the Ramming vehicle's hit points.
- **Dodging:** flying erratically makes all Shooting (both enemy and players) TN 16.

### Gunners
*Skill: Shooting, Target Number 14*
Handheld weapons can be as powerful as vehicle weapons so the players can choose to use either. Gunners can choose to shoot the enemy vehicle itself (target number 14) or people inside or hanging off it (target number 16). Shields must be taken out first (target number 14).

### Engineer
*Skill: Micro Engineering, Target Number 12*
You may not want the engineer fiddling with the vehicle that's keeping you in the air but they can add extra boost to the Pilot's Pilot Grav skill check or fix the shields. Their choices are:

- **Power to the engine!** Boost in speed, when escaping, +2 to Pilot's Pilot Grav check.
- **Power to the Grav plates!** Boost in agility, when Get into a firing position +2 to Pilot's Pilot Grav check.
- **Shield repair** brings a shield back online.

### Hacker
*Skill: Hacking Target Number 12*
A hacker has the ability to affect the environment and the enemy directly to help the team. This is largely down to the imagination of the player, ideas include:

- **Re-route traffic** to make escape route clear or help dodge bullets
- **Open doorways in buildings** for shortcuts
- **Hack the enemy vehicle** to make it lose control or power. TN 16.

## Turn Order
All target numbers are 12 but each role can give a bonus to another role.

- The team declare what they are doing that turn such as (but not limited to)
  - Escape
  - Getting into a firing position
  - Ramming into an enemy
  - Dodging
- The Hacker performs Hacking skill to help
- The Engineer performs Micro Engineering skill check to help
- The pilot rolls Grav Pilot skill to perform the action
- Gunners shoot using Shooting skill

## Doing Damage
If the vehicle has shields then those must be depleted first. Once the shields are gone, damage is done to the vehicle or its occupants, depending on the style of the vehicle and how good your gunner is.

> For example: an open top Anchorage R leaves its occupants exposed, whereas a Kestrel with the door shut does not.

Every vehicle has hit points like a player character and when those hot points are depleted then the vehicle is inoperable and it will start to fall like a rock. Hit points becoming zero does not mean that the vehicle disappears, just that it is inoperable.

## Ending combat
Combat ends when one side is destroyed, or the escaping vehicle passes their pilot roll. Escaping means that they cannot be shot at again but are likely to be tracked over Gaia or visually (use Hacking target number 12 to become invisible on Gaia).

## Using the autopilot
In small teams, players may choose to put the vehicle on autopilot. The autopilot can navigate around the city but at the first sign of danger it will stop somewhere safe. If the players want to stop that from happening then they must hack the autopilot first (Hacking, target number 12).

## Boarding
There is a long Icar tradition of jumping from one vehicle to another. If the pilot rams someone then anyone in the car may jump onto the other car with a successful skill check. Failing the skill check usually means dangling by the fingertips! The further the team is from the other vehicle, the more difficult the jump is.

# Hacking
Gaia is the 3D virtual world that acts as the internet in Icar. The whole human race revolves around the use of Gaia. For more details on Gaia itself (and the different objects you get in it), see the Gaia section in the Background. Hacking is performing illegal actions in Gaia usually by releasing intelligent hacking programs called Daemons to disrupt or destroy legitimate intelligent Gaia programs. Choosing which Daemons to use is the skill part of Hacking.

When considering Gaia, it is best to think of it as the real world rather than a 21st Century computer system. If a message needs to travel through Gaia, you might assume it moves instantly and although it is instant, you can intercept the message still. Do not worry about the technical concerns here. The aim is to make Gaia playable without any in depth technical knowledge.

## What Hacking is used for
Hacking is used to support the rest of the team. Following is a selection of actions a Hacker can take, these are only common examples and are far from a complete list.

### Finding secured data
Breaking and entering into corporate and personal Gaia spaces is the best place to find juicy data. From corporate systems you can grab employment records, lists of workers, secret plans for future projects, plans of the building layouts and even incriminating files. From personal Gaia Spaces, you can read 3D immersive diary entries, steal the contact information of friends and view their information.

### Opening real world doors
Breaking into places involves either Hacking the door panel or cutting your way in. For getting access to a Spacecraft, the airlock will have two sets of controls, so you will need to Hack twice.

### Accessing the Undergaia
The Undergaia is the name given to accidental fissures in Gaia, which most users cannot sense or locate. The Undergaia is useful for connecting with criminals, finding out restricted data, buying or selling information or hiding data and illegal Daemons. More information on the Undergaia is provided in the Gaia section in the background later.

## Hacking vehicles and spacecraft
It is possible to disrupt the systems on a Spacecraft or vehicle.  Spacecraft and vehicles have many Gaia Entities (intelligent programs) that automatically control many of the systems. A Hacker can disrupt these systems but only for a short period of time as the Entities will be regenerated by the systems they run. With luck, it is possible to shut down systems with Hacking entirely but it takes many successful rolls.

### Hacking Vehicles
Vehicles use Entities for opening doors, navigating traffic, driving, maintaining power, gravity dampening fields (which removes g-forces), controlling shielding and a food and drinks bioreorganiser. 

To Hack into a Vehicle, you need to roll twice to get into the security and then once for each system you wish to disrupt. The system will be off in the next turn for that turn only.

If you manage to successfully roll 10 hacking rolls in a vehicle, all further system hacks will be permanent!

### Hacking Spacecraft
Hacking Spacecraft is a much more difficult affair as a single Spacecraft has thousands of Entities with massive duplication of effort. As such Hacking Spacecraft systems must be performed from inside or standing on the hull of the craft.

### Hacking Augmented Humans
Humans with Cyberware can be hacked if they have a Gaia Link. Cheap bionics suits require 4 passes and expensive bionics suits may require 16 successful rolls of Hacking! Once inside, the Hacker can do all manner of damage, such as switching off the ability to walk or balance, any of the sensors. Bionic implants will not allow Hackers to kill the augmented human but they can be locked inside their own body by Hacking, needing a Medic with Bionics systems to be unlocked.

## Hacking Daemons
Hacking Entities are special intelligent Gaia programs that subvert Gaia and can be used to help a Hacker achieve certain tasks. Hacking Entities each have a specific goal and can be purchased in the Undergaia. To bring a Hacking Entity to life, a successful Hacking roll is required. Some Hacking Entities have more requirements.
A full list of Hacking Entities is in the Technology Section but some examples are given here.

### Back Door
Once you have hacked into a system, you can create a Back Door to let you (and anyone else) back in. Back Doors are Easy to find by other hackers or system administrators.

### Generator Overloader
The Generator Overloader will set a Generator on a path of self-destruction. Small generators (in emergency lighting) take 60 seconds to overload, whereas large generators (such as in spacecraft) may take up to an hour.

## Hacking during combat
Hackers can play their part during combat by changing the environment (opening or closing doors, switching off lights, opening air locks, turning off the gravity). The act of using Gaia is a physical one, a Hacker uses his hands, voice and whole body to control Gaia. The number of hacking actions that can be made in a turn is equal to their Shift attribute.

If bionically augmented, then the number of rolls increases hugely as it is the augmented Shift attribute that is used, not the natural one.

## Other useful Skills
Hacking has its limitations. As a Hacker, you might be excellent at breaking into systems but it does not allow you to do everything. In that case, you will need to use other Skills. If another member of the party has those Skills, they can join you on the Hacking run and can use their appropriate Skills when needed. Here are the most common Skills useful to the Hacker.

### Impersonation (Academic Skill Tree)
If a Hacker is found somewhere they should not be by another person then pretending you do belong can stop you from being thrown out. This will only work against humans or Security Entities with plenty of intelligence.

# Space Combat
In space combat, every player acts to bring down the gunner's Shooting target number (STN) to give them a better chance of hitting their targets. Shields are lost, hull is damaged and spacecraft systems (life support/engines etc) are targeted. Each spacecraft has a base Shooting target number and then each player crew member does their specialist job to reduce it or help other players. The jobs are Operations, Engineer and Pilot and Gunner.

For a crew member to reduce the Shooting target number, they need to pass a skill check of their own. If they fail then they have no effect this turn. Players choose their action from a list of options; options that are harder to achieve have a bigger effect on the Shooting target number.

At the end of the player's turn, the gunner makes a Shooting skill check against the target number.

Shields need to be destroyed first and then the gunner can choose to shoot the hull (easy) or a system (hard).

## Assigning Roles
Before the combat begins, each player should have their roles defined: Operations is in charge of keeping everyone organised, the Engineer configures and repairs, the Pilot manoeuvres into the best firing position and Gunners use weapon clusters to shoot. Each role gets a list of actions they can take in the turn.

## Hackers in Space Combat
It is not possible to hack a spacecraft through Gaia. The team can place a Gaia Mole Daemon on board before the combat but they need to be physically onboard the spacecraft to do so. The sorts of things a Hacker might do includes:

- Switching off the life support / gravity (target number 12)
- Switching off the generators (target number 12)
- Opening every single door, including airlocks (target number 16)

Hackers can usually operate at the speed of thought but in space combat, the systems they are dealing with are intensely complex, so they may only perform one action a turn.

## Strategy and tactics bonus
If the players are expecting the combat, they can verbally make a case for a strategy and tactics bonus. If they convince the gamesmaster that their situation gives them an advantage then the Shooting target number can be -1 or -2 for the first round.

## Player roles

### Operations
*Skill: Spacecraft Ops*
Operations is responsible for understanding the overall state of the spacecraft and gaining the initiative. Operations has the final say in whether the craft is attacking or fleeing. Choose one from the list below:

- Investigate the enemy spacecraft (target number 12) for weapons, damage and their Shooting target number. Allows a better decision whether to fight or flee. 
- Put a die into the pool.
- Operations crew help out Engineering. -2 to Engineering target number.
- -1 to STN.
- Cajole the enemies. Choose an appropriate "talking" Skill (Persuade, Interrogate, Street Deal, Impersonate, Intimidate, Counsel), contact the enemies, give a short speech, pass skill check (target number 12). -2 to STN, or more if the GM deems the speech was particularly entertaining.

### Engineering
*Skill: Macro Engineering*
The chief engineer can re-route power and boost various systems to either improve other's rolls or just improve the performance of the spacecraft as a whole. Choose one from the list below.

- Reroute power. -2 to STN.
- Shut down everything non-combat related (target number 14). One use per combat. -3 to STN.
- Power to Engines. -1 to STN, -2 to Pilot's target number.
- Dump the energy web (target number 14). -4 to pilot target number this turn. One use per combat.
- Technobabble Deluxe (target number 16). -4 to STN.

- Travel to an inoperable system.
- Repair an inoperable system (target number 12), no STN bonus, see below.
- Power to the Engies! (target number 14). Helps repair team. -3 other Engineers target numbers.

### Pilot
*Skill: Spacecraft Pilot*
The pilot needs to get the spacecraft into a position where the gunners can best damage the enemy. Choose one from the list below:

- Aggressive. -1 to STN.
- Spinning and skidding (target number 14) -2 to STN
- In Every Axis (target number 16) -3 to STN
- Ripping balls (target number 18) -5 to STN.
- Run away +6 to STN.

### Gunner
*Skill: Shooting*
The gunners take it in turn to shoot at the enemy spacecraft. While the enemy has shields up or when shooting the hull, -6 to STN.

If the enemy has run out of shields, the Gunners may choose to shoot a system on the enemy spacecraft. Systems each have their own modifier to STN, they are written on the spacecraft sheet.

If the Gunner misses the system then they miss the enemy altogether, damage is not done to the hull.

## Damage
Spacecraft damage is dealt in 1000s of hit points, or _K_ for short. Gunners shoot from weapon clusters that are spread over the surface of the hull. A single Gunner can always shoot the enemy but not always with all the guns (because some will point the wrong way). 

A Gunner will do an amount of damage (measured in _K_) depending on the size of the weapon cluster. Clusters start at 5K damage per turn and go up to 50K.

### Shields
A spacecraft has a number of shields. It only takes one successful hit to take a shield down. A shield remains up for an entire turn, no matter how many Gunners shoot at it.

### Hull Damage
Shooting the hull will slowly chip away at the hull's damage. When the hull has taken enough damage then systems that are exposed are made inoperable. The damage table shows at which point a system is rendered inoperable.

If those systems are fixed and the hull is damaged again, then any systems that are exposed are immediately made inoperable.

### System Damage
As hull damage accumulates, it will reach a level that affects a system. In that case, it is rendered inoperable. Every spacecraft has its own system table that lists each major system, the amount of hull damage required to make that system inoperable and a target number for directly shooting the system.

> NEED SPACECRAFT SYSTEM DAMAGE

A system can be targeted directly even before the hull has been worn away. That carries a much higher target number, so is only possible for more capable spacecraft crews. Shooting a system renders it inoperable. Systems are rarely destroyed, unless the gamesmaster says so.

Inoperable systems can be fixed by the engineering team in the following turn.

### System game effects
When a system becomes inoperable, the spacecraft is limited in what it can do. The entries in the spacecraft's damage 

- Shield Generator. Your shields will not recharge.
- Tractor Beam. You can't pull objects toward you or tow.
- Light Jump Engine. You cannot travel to other systems. 
- Grav Field Emitter. Artificial gravity is off. When repairing systems, engineers Target Number is now 16.
- Grav Engine. The pilot no longer effects the Shooting target number (STN). You cannot run away.
- Generators. Main power is lost. Ops no longer effects the Shooting target number (STN). Weapons only thing left.
- Life Support. You have 10 hours of air left.
- Energy Web Collapse (cannot be targeted). No power around the ship at all, no weapons, spacecraft is a wreck.

## Enemy Shooting Back
Once the players have taken their turn, each of the enemies take a turn. The GM will decide on the enemy's Gunner ability in the range 2 (awful) to 10 (masterful), 6 being average and the enemy's Shoot Target Number between 12 (easy) to 20 (hard). The GM then rolls a die to hit. This is simplified to keep the space combat quick.

## Critical pass and failure
Critical passes and failures (die roll of a 10) need to have a narrative player description before the GM hands out a bonus.

- Critical Operations pass works out what the enemy is about to do, the enemy Combat Initiative goes to 0 next turn.
- Critical Engineering pass manages to repair two inoperable systems in a single turn by forcing more power through them both.
- Critical Pilot pass puts the spacecraft in a place where the enemy is unable to shoot the player spacecraft but the players can shoot back.
- Critical Gunner pass lets the Gunner hit a system rather than just the hull.

## Ending Combat
In Icar, spacecraft only explodes theatrically in the rare scenario that their cargo is unstable. Most spacecraft grind away, becoming less useful, then inoperable and finally uninhabitable. Therefore, spacecraft combat ends in the following ways:

- Before too much damage is done, one spacecraft sues for peace.
- One spacecraft has been damaged to the point of "Energy Web Collapse", at which point it is a wreck.
- One spacecraft runs away

### Suing for peace
This is the option that most crews will take unless they have a death wish. The winner of the battle might not listen and choose to turn the spacecraft into a wreck but that doesn't mean that the crew inside are hurt.

### Energy Web Collapse
When the spacecraft has taken as much hull damage as it can handle then it turns into a dead wreck. No power, no life support and finally, no weapons either. The winning spacecraft might decide to loot the wreck, take hostages and so on. This is a catastrophic end to a battle and should be avoided!

### Run Away
A pilot may elect to Run Away. If they succeed then they may Light Jump on the next turn and be far from the battle. Gunners may fire but hitting targets is more difficult. If a spacecraft cannot Light Jump (because the engine is damaged) but it has successfully "Run Away" then attackers can pursue but not fire; the pilot has managed to gain enough distance away from the attackers to make their weapons inefficient.

Running Away is an effective tactic, giving the engineers time to repair before either Light Jumping or running again. It also gives the Captains of the spacecraft time to trade insults, call for reinforcements and prepare for another bout.

A spacecraft that has Light Jumped can be followed. See the Technology -> Space Travel section for more information.

## Repair
Engineers can repair damage systems. It takes 1 turn for the engineer to get to the system and one turn to fix it (Spacecraft Systems Skill, Target Number 12).

If the hull damage has reached the system then repairing the system will work until the hull is next hit.

### Multiple Engineers
Only one Engineer can add to the Combat Initiative but Multiple Engineers can fix different spacecraft systems. A team of Engineers can keep a floundering ship alive quite easily by constantly repairing things as they are damaged.

## Fighters
Fighters are small spacecraft. In any given turn, the fighter must choose only one of the roles to assume. Fighters have a higher Combat Initiative, fewer shields and do lower damage.

## Spacecraft Special Rules
Some spacecraft have special rules due to their size or systems installed. In that case, the special rules always override these ones. If there is a conflict between enemy spacecraft and player spacecraft then the players always have the advantage; bec0ause they are heroes!

## Players Working Together
The GM decides how much conferring between players is allowed when coming up with the best way to lower the Shooting target number (STN). In most cases, the players should be able to confer, deciding together who will do what during the turn to maximise the STN without going overboard.

*For example*
The Operation crew member might choose to Investigate the Shooting target number of the enemy spacecraft at the start of the battle because they know that the Gunner has a good chance of hitting the shields.

When under stress or if the spacecraft has taken heavy fire amongst lots of enemies then the GM might decide a strict order of players deciding their actions, taking each role in turn.

### Less than four players
If the vacant roles can't be filled with NPCs then the players can swap between roles. The Gunner role is the only one that must be filled. If a player does not have the required skill then they may still attempt an action based on their attribute and die alone.
