# The Core Mechanic

When you want your character to do an action that requires some skill, you will roll a die to decide if you pass or fail. This is called the core mechanic. 

It works like this:

> Skill + Attribute + Bonuses + D10 must be equal to or larger than Difficulty.

The gamesmaster will begin by setting the difficulty (see the table below) and then asking for a particular skill. The default difficulty is 12. The player will then suggest an attribute to use and remind the gamesmaster of any equipment they are using to help with a bonus. The player then rolls a D10 and the total is compared to a target number; meeting or exceeding the target number is a pass!

If the player doesn't have a Skill then that's OK, just use the Attribute and D10.

> Example: John Smith wants to prise open an airlock into a wreck. The GM says that there is no power to the door, so the target number is 12 and Macro Engineering skill, John has a 4 in Macro Engineering. John's player asks to use the Wit Attribute (4) and a Tech Kit (1). The GM agrees. John's player rolls a D10, gets a 5. His total is 14 (4 + 4 + 1 + 5), which is more than 12, so a pass. The airlock vibrates and grinds open.

> Example: John Smith wants to force open a space crate festooned with holographic warning stickers. The GM says that the target number is 12 and skill required is Hacking, which John has 1 in. John's player is going carefully, so uses his Wit Attribute (4). John's player rolls a D10 and gets a 6, which gives a total of 11 (4 + 1 + 6), which is a fail. Something inside the crate wakes up.

> Example: John Smith is desperately trying to restart the engines of the Orbihaul in a panic to escape a monster robot that has just burst from a crate. The GM says that the panic is making the task harder and sets the target number to 14, the skill required is Macro Engineering (4). John's player wants to use Wit but the GM says that everyone is panicking so he must choose another. John Smith's player chooses to hammer the engine with brute force, and use the Meat attribute (2) with a wrench from his Tech Kit to help (1). John's player rolls a 7, giving a total of 14 (4 + 2 + 1 + 7), which is a pass (only just!). The engine blinks and roars into life, the Orbihaul tears away from the doomed wreck.

## Setting the Target Number
The GM gets to choose the target number depending on how difficult the action is.

_Difficulty Level Table_
| Difficulty | Number |
|------------|--------|
| Easy	| 10 |
| Normal | 12 |
| Hard | 16 |
| Impossible! | 22 |

## Critical Failure and Success
On a roll of 1, the character always fails. On a roll of 10, they always pass. These are called criticals and when they happen then the players get to decide what happens. In failure then it should be the worst possible outcome. Successes can be narrated by the winning player, failures narrated by the gamesmaster. Other players are encouraged to offer ideas about how the critical fail occurs. Fun or humorous ideas should be rewarded with roleplaying points.

## Optional: The Shared Dice Pool
At the start of the game, put a pot or hat in the middle of the table with a number of D10s equal to the number of players. When the players roll a D10, they can choose to pick a die from the hat to add to their total. The player can choose to keep doing this until the dice run out.

Any remaining dice at the end of the game get turned into roleplaying points, shared out between the players. This makes the game a little easier but adds an element of co-operation for the players. It's especially useful when you have less than 4 players.

# Combat

There are four types of combat in Icar: Close Combat (hand-to-hand), Fire Fighting (ranged weapons), Vehicle combat and Space combat. Initiative is used to determine who goes first and then players take turns. 

For all of these combat types, distance is measured by metres. This is used for ranges and movement rates. Time is split into Turns. Each turn is 3 seconds and a player may make spend that turn doing whatever action they like (providing it is possible). 

> Example: John Smith wins the initiative, draws his weapon first, rolls dice first and splatters the adversary's right arm all over the wall. The adversary doesn't get to shoot and has one glove too many.

## Turn Actions

A Turn is three seconds. In some cases, a character can do many different quick tasks in this time. Here is a list of actions which can be performed in a turn.

_Turn Action Table_                                                                                       
| Action                    | Effect                                            |                         
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|   
| Move                      | Move up to 4 times your Shift Attribute in metres.|
| Change Magazine           | Put a new Magazine into a weapon. |
| Change Weapon             | Select a new weapon and stow previous weapon. | 
| Recover Stun              | A Character will recover 10 Stun points if the Character remains inactive. |
| Get into / out of vehicle | As suggested. | 
| Say one thing             | Along with an action, a Character may utter one thing. | 
| Turn on shield            | Free! Does not take a turn but a shield can be raised in a turn. | 
| Use Close Combat Combo    | Execute a close combat combo against one or more opponents. | 
| Fire weapon               | Fire your weapon! | 

## Entering Combat

When a combat begins, the gamesmaster will follow these steps:

1. State that combat has started. Announce the start of the combat turn. Make sure all players are aware that combat has begun, otherwise they may be in a vulnerable state.
2. Describe where everyone and everything is. This allows each player to be certain of what situation their Character is in. You might like to draw crosses on the map to show where you are.
3. Roll for initiative. This gives an order of play. Initiative = Shift + Battle + D10.
4. Players take turns. Highest initiative goes first.

## The Turn Sequence

There are different turn sequences for each type of combat.  Once a combat sequence is complete, the gamesmaster will announce that the combat turn is over. 

## Healing

If you can step out of the fight, spend a moment shaking the haze away then you regain 1 stun per turn. A successful Medicine skill check with a Medkit hypo can bring you back to half your maximum stun.

Healing without being treated by a medic is slow. You must be resting to regain 1 hit point a day. Your character can still perform actions as long as they are not physically or mentally tiring.

A medic can heal hit points up to their skill in Medicine once a day. Medic kits give a better chance of success. A fully equipped medical facility can heal _at least_ an extra 10 per day.

### When you run out of Stun or Hit Points

When your Stun is 0 then you are unconscious. Your Stun can go below 0, which means that you will be asleep for that many turns.

When your hit points hit 0 then you have 2 minutes to live. As long as your brain is intact you can be saved. If you're vaporised, you're just dead. Within those 2 minutes, a successful Medicine skill check can stabilise you but that can only be tried 10 times.

### Bits blown off 

If the narrative demands that parts of the body are destroyed beyond repair then you must seek bionics. Organs can be regrown but whole limbs cannot. See the bionics section for more details.

### Star Civilisation Medical AI

Star Civilisation have a medical Artificial Intelligence that can help over Gaia. The service is free to use and gives +2 on a Medicine related skill roll (including the bionics ones). See Star Civilisation Healthcare XXXXXXX.

## Shields

Shields are an energy field that drains the energy from things hitting it. It only stops high energy objects.

A shield has Hit Points, which is the damage it can stop in a single combat turn. At the start of the next turn, its Hit Points return. If a shield takes more damage than it has hit points in a single turn then it shuts down at the end of the turn, taking all the damage that hits it. While a shield is on, no damage hits the user. 

A shut down shield can only be restarted after 60 seconds and with a Micro Engineering skill check.
Bigger shield systems can have multiple shields. This means that when one shield goes down, another shield pops up in its place immediately. 

# Close Combat

When you're near enough to smell their fear, that's Close Combat. You can always hit someone once in a turn like any other action but it's more fun to chain moves together in a combo. By default you use the Battle attribute with your skill check but that's negotiable, depending on the situation.

## Hitting once

To hit another character once: perform a Skill check using Street Fighting and Battle. If you surprise the enemy then the target number is 12. If they know you're coming then the highest roll wins. The loser loses stun, the amount being the winner's Meat attribute. 

> Without warning, Byrnie punches Simon squarely in the face. The GM gives a difficulty of 12 and set the skill as Street Fighting. Byrnie has a Street Fighting of 1 and a Battle attribute of 3. He rolls a D10, gets a 9, giving a total of 13 (1 + 3). This is more than 12 so he hits Simon. He is not carrying any weapons so Simon takes 3 stun (which is Byrnie's Meat attribute).

> In the next round, Byrnie and Simon try and hit each other at the same time. They are not using Combos, just bashing each other. They're now in a proper fight, so they are going to roll against each other. Byrnie rolls 5, giving him a total of 9 (5 + 3 + 1) Simon's Battle attribute is 4, Street Fighting is 2 and he rolls 4, giving him a total of 10 (2 + 4 + 4). Simon wins so Byrnie must remove stun equal to Simon's Meat attribute, which is 4 points.

If you are holding just about anything and want to hit someone once then perform a Street Fighting and Battle skill check and do Meat damage and Meat stun.

> Later Simon sneaks up behind Byrnie with a table leg and hits him over the back of the head. Simon's Battle attribute is 4 and Street Fighting is 2. He needs a 12 to hit Byrnie and rolls 6. His total is 12 (6 + 4 + 2) so he hits Byrnie. Byrnie removes 4 stun (Simon's Meat attribute) and because Simon is holding a table leg, he removes 4 hit points too. The Gamesmaster tells Byrnie that he's bleeding from a nasty gash on his head.

## Combos

A combo is a series of moves that your character can perform in a single turn flow such as Headbutt, Punch, Trip, Stamp. If you have the Street Fighting skill of 1 or higher then you can spend roleplaying points to build combos. A combo does damage and stun and has a difficulty. The more damage and stun your combo does, the more difficult it will be to execute. Some moves can have extra benefits, such as knocking the weapon from the other's hand. 

### Using a Combo

When it comes to your turn, you choose one of your combos from your list of combos. *You must verbally describe your combo before rolling a die*. If you forget, the combo fails automatically. Then roll a skill check using Street Fighting and Battle and subtracting the combo difficulty. The enemy you are fighting removes the combo's damage from their hit points and the stun from their stun.

 The default target number for NPCs is 10.

> Battle + Street Fighting - Difficulty + D10 = 10 or more.

> 'I'm going to hit the Star Enforcer with combo 1: punch, trip, stamp. Difficulty is 1.' said Byrnie and rolls the D10. Although he rolls a 10, he loses the round because there was no description first.

> 'I am going use kick the Star Enforcer in the groin, then I'm going to push him over the fence to trip, jump over myself and stamp on his face.'. combo #1, which is Punch, Trip, Stamp and has a difficulty of 2.

## Using a Combo Against Another Player Character

If two player characters are fighting, or perhaps a player character is fighting an NPC important enough to have their own combos, then the winner is the character with the highest score. Critical pass (rolling 10) or fail (rolling 1) are automatic success or failure. The the totals are equal then roll again. Roll initiative to find out who chooses their combo first; lowest chooses and narrates their combo first.

> 'While running, I'm going to barge into Simon and stamp on his groin twice. Using Combo 2, difficulty 2.' said Byrn.
> 'Seeing him come in, I'm going to bring him to a halt by headbutting three times. Using Combo 3, difficulty 3.' said Simon.
> Byrn and Simon roll D10s, Byrn's rolls 5, his total is 7 (1 + 3 - 2 + 5). Simon rolls 3, his total is 6 (2 + 4 - 3 + 3).
> Byrn's narration wins and Simon is left on the floor!

## Trip and Hold

Trip makes an enemy prone (lying on the floor). In the next round, the enemy must make a Street Fighting with shift opposed skill check (or use the Spring to Feet swap move). 'Hold' means the enemy cannot move until their break free using Street Fighting and Meat. You can Combo against the foe who is prone or held, if they pass their standing up or breaking free check then your Combo will fail.

To struggle free from a Trip and a Hold (being pinned down on the ground) then you must roll a Hard difficulty Street Fighting skill check with Meat or Shift.

## Swapping out Attributes

The attribute you use can be negotiated with the GM before the dice are rolled. Any attribute can be married with a fighting skill if the player is persuasive enough. In the example above, Simon could have used his Shift attribute of 4 because headbutting someone running at you is more a matter of dexterity than fighting prowess.

## Using Weapons in Combos

To use a weapon in a combo you need to have a good enough skill. For hand weapons, you need Street Fighting at level 2 and higher. For using a firearm (pistol, rifle or sub-machine gun) in close quarters then you need Gun Fu at level 1. The damage and stun you do is listed on the weapon if you're firing it. If you're using it as a blunt object to bash someone, then use the Meat of the character.

## Humans versus Augs

Humans are puny compared to those with bionic augmentation (Augs). Augs can choose to do damage with their Combos, the damage being the same as the stun. As Augs have a higher Meat attribute, they do more damage, have moresStun and regain stun quicker. Humans should avoid getting into a fight with an Aug at all costs. The same can be said for fighting with people in powered armour and insane automatons.

> EXAMPLE! XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX NEEDS BIONICS FIRST

## Using Advanced Close Combat Skills

Street Fighting covers the majority of fighting scenarios but there is also Gun Fu (close quarters gun play) and Akarak Art (like martial arts but much tougher). No matter where the moves come from, you always use your Street Fighting skill.

## Swap Moves

As you improve in the close combat skills of Street Fighting, Gun Fu and Akarak Art, you get the ability to improvise by swapping out moves in your Combo. Swap moves are only for that one use and have a difficulty. Add the swap move difficulty on top of the existing Combo difficulty, even though you are replacing one of your moves. You can only swap one move in a turn (until you reach Akarak Art at level 3). You can build swap moves in a Combo normally if you wish. 

The simplest swap that anyone can do is a Hold (requires Street Fighting level 1).

> Simon wants to headbutt Byrnie three times again. Byrnie is fed up with Simon headbutting him. Byrnie takes his Punch, Trip, Stamp combo and replaces Trip with Hold and says 'I want to punch him in the face and then as he's reeling, grab him round the shoulders.' The Stamp move won't happen because Hold ends the Combo. Hold has a difficulty of 1 added to the Combo's difficulty of 2. Byrnie rolls a D10 and gets an 8, his total is 9 (1 + 3 - 3 + 8). This beats Simon's roll. Simon will need to pass an opposed Meat check next turn to break free.

Combos and swap moves can become quite complex and specific to a situation. When a player chooses their swap moves, they are responsible for understanding what they are going to say in the narrative. If they cannot describe it in a way that others can understand then they cannot use it.

> Take the Gun Fu based Combo: Puppet, Reload, Reverse, Dismantle has the narrative 'Grab hold of the enemy with a gun and shoot their friend with it, reload it, shoot them with it and then dismantle it.' This means that the weapon will have fired twice in a single turn but it's an expensive Combo, so let the player enjoy it if they pass!

## How to Build a Combo

First you need to know what you want to achieve from your Combo in terms of difficulty, or achieving a goal. For example, you might start with an easy Combo that just punches someone as many times as you can (which is free!). You might also have one that leaves the opponent prone.

To build the Combo, choose the moves from the Combo table below, adding up Stun, Damage and Difficulty. You can have as many moves in your Combo as your Battle attribute. Each move has a skill requirement (except punch). Use Roleplaying Points to buy the Combo, the cost is the same as its difficulty.
Put your completed Combo on the front page of your character sheet with the Stun, Damage and Difficulty. You can have 6 Combos. If you run out of room and want to replace a Combo then you can but you can't edit a Combo that's already there.

## Pre-Built Example Combos

The Combos below are designed for a Battle attribute of 3 and Street Fighting and Gun Fu of 5.

- 'I'm going to barge him over and stamp on his head twice.' Leaves the enemy prone. Trip, Stamp, Stamp. Difficulty: 1. Stun: Meat x 2. Damage: 0. 
- 'I'm going to get really close, headbutt him, knee him in the groin and then uppercut into his face.' Headbutt, Kick, Punch. Difficulty: 2. Stun: Meat x 3. Damage: Meat. Good for starting fights.
- 'I'm going to kick him back up to the table, push him over it and as he tumbles onto the floor slam my heel into his chest.' Kick, Trip, Stamp. Difficulty: 2. Stun: Meat x 3. Damage: 0. Great for a bar fight.
- 'I'm going to pick up the leg from the broken table and keep hitting him while screaming.' Strike, Strike, Strike. Difficulty: 3. Stun: Meat x 3. Damage: Meat x 3.

## Fighting More Than One Foe

If you want to fight two people then pick a Combo for each foe (it can be the same for each) and roll a skill check with a -2 difficulty for each additional foe. Two foes -2, three foes -4, four foes -6 and so on.

> Byrnie has won the initiative against Simon and Gideon. 'I'm going to kick Simon in the groin and then the face (Kick, Kick) and I'm going to reach out and punch Gideon in the stomach and face twice (Punch, Punch).' Byrnie will need to roll once for each Combo add an extra -2 difficulty onto each roll.

## Close Combat Skills

These skills can be raised just like any other skill.

> MOVES TABLE

# Firefighting

Fire fighting deals with ranged combat and firearms. It is assumed that all fire fights happen simultaneously and initiative is merely used to allow the more combat aware to see what happens to everything else before making their decision.

## Firearms

In Icar, weapons are not written down on part of the Character sheet but are included as handouts (folded paper into cards) and then kept with the Character sheet. This removes confusion about what the character is carrying. If the player does not have the sheet, they do not have the weapon. On the next page is the Nelson H1 from the Equipment Index, please refer to this as an example. You can download the handouts in the Equipment Index and print as needed.

> PICTURE OF NELSON

For quick reference, a list of weapons with their pictures is included in the technology section of this book but it is highly recommended to use the hand-outs as they contain more information about the weapon and extra features.

### Photo and Name
The picture shows a representation of the weapon with its name. The picture isn't upside down! Once you've folded the weapon sheet, it will be the correct way up.

### Features
The weapon's features are statistics that are used outside of combat. They are:

1. Cost. If bought new from a regular dealer.
1. Type of weapon. Gives you a sense of what it is best used for.
1. Rarity. This is a target number for a Street Deal skill check, lower is better.
1. Additional Features. These are accompanied with a heading and a description. Things such as 'Grav Balancing 'are additional features. For descriptions of what these technologies mean, see the Technology section of this book.
1. Stock Options. Some weapons are so versatile that the manufacturer may create them with possible additions straight from the factory. These come with a tick box, a price and a Rarity.

### Note
Either used for further pictures or options or for a brief history and description for the weapon.

### Statistics
The weapon's statistics are:
- Damage: how many hit points the weapon removes from the enemy.
- Magazine: how many shots you get before you must reload.
- To hit modifier: Added to your skill roll. 

## The Turn Sequence

### Begin Fire Fight
Fire Fight combat is entered into if the combatants fire weapons. The GM must state what targets there are, at what range they are and whether they are moving or in cover.

### Roll Initiative
Each combatant, whether they be NPC or player, rolls for initiative:

> Initiative = Battle + Shift + D10

The lower initiative, is the worse combatant and thus must decide what to do first, without having seen the outcome of everyone else's actions. 

### State Target and Roll

This is performed as a skill check. The player (or NPC) states the weapon she is using and the target she is shooting at. The gamesmaster sets the skill (usually Shooting) and a target number based on the situation (range, whether people are moving, the environment and so on). The attribute is usually Battle but the player may negotiate like any other skill check before adding on the weapon's To Hit modifier. If you hit, the target takes the damage from the gun.

> Skill + Attribute + Weapon To Hit Modifier + D10 must be equal to or larger than target number.

> Simon is sitting drinking Byrnie's beer. Byrnie's bursts in, his sense of humour fails and draws an Arms 3 sub-machine gun. He tells the GM he is shooting Simon with it. Simon is sitting nearby, so the GM decided that the difficulty is easy and sets a skill of Shooting and target number of 10. Byrnie is happy to use the Battle attribute, the Arms 3 to hit modifier is -1. Byrnie has a Battle of 3 and a Shooting of 3. He rolls a 5 giving 10 (3 + 3 - 1 + 5), which is only just a hit. Simon takes 20 damage and 20 stun, thrown from his chair.

### Example Difficulty Chart

# Vehicle Combat
In Icar all cars fly. This makes vehicle combat somewhere between great car chases and dog fights. Everyone in the vehicle can help in the combat and take on a role.

The pilot dodges, rams, speeds and gets into good firing positions, gunners use mounted or hand-held weapons, engineers adjust the setup of the vehicle to fit the situation and hackers throw chaos in the path. You don't need all of these roles to do vehicle combat.

## Roles

### Pilot  
*Skill: Pilot Grav, Target Number 12*
By manoeuvring the vehicle, the pilot aims to meet the goal of the team as a whole. The pilot has the final say because they are at the controls. The goals are:

- **Escape:** only possible if the escaping vehicle is faster.
- **Get into a firing position:** Gives a +2 to the Gunner's Shooting skill check.
- **Ram:** smashing into the enemy vehicle or pushing them into the floor, a building or another vehicle. Also makes jumping from one vehicle to another normal difficulty (target number 12). Each vehicle takes damage that's 10% of the Ramming vehicle's hit points.
- **Dodging:** flying erratically makes all Shooting (both enemy and players) TN 16.

### Gunners
*Skill: Shooting, Target Number 14*
Handheld weapons can be as powerful as vehicle weapons so the players can choose to use either. Gunners can choose to shoot the enemy vehicle itself (target number 14) or people inside or hanging off it (target number 16). Shields must be taken out first (target number 14).

### Engineer
*Skill: Micro Engineering, Target Number 12*
You may not want the engineer fiddling with the vehicle that's keeping you in the air but they can add extra boost to the Pilot's Pilot Grav skill check or fix the shields. Their choices are:

- **Power to the engine!** Boost in speed, when escaping, +2 to Pilot's Pilot Grav check.
- **Power to the Grav plates!** Boost in agility, when Get into a firing position +2 to Pilot's Pilot Grav check.
- **Shield repair** brings a shield back online.

### Hacker
*Skill: Hacking Target Number 12*
A hacker has the ability to affect the environment and the enemy directly to help the team. This is largely down to the imagination of the player, ideas include:

- **Re-route traffic** to make escape route clear or help dodge bullets
- **Open doorways in buildings** for shortcuts
- **Hack the enemy vehicle** to make it lose control or power. TN 16.

## Turn Order
All target numbers are 12 but each role can give a bonus to another role.

- The team declare what they are doing that turn such as (but not limited to)
  - Escape
  - Getting into a firing position
  - Ramming into an enemy
  - Dodging
- The Hacker performs Hacking skill to help
- The Engineer performs Micro Engineering skill check to help
- The pilot rolls Grav Pilot skill to perform the action
- Gunners shoot using Shooting skill

## Doing Damage
If the vehicle has shields then those must be depleted first. Once the shields are gone, damage is done to the vehicle or its occupants, depending on the style of the vehicle and how good your gunner is.

> For example: an open top Anchorage R leaves its occupants exposed, whereas a Kestrel with the door shut does not.

Every vehicle has hit points like a player character and when those hot points are depleted then the vehicle is inoperable and it will start to fall like a rock. Hit points becoming zero does not mean that the vehicle disappears, just that it is inoperable.

## Ending combat
Combat ends when one side is destroyed, or the escaping vehicle passes their pilot roll. Escaping means that they cannot be shot at again but are likely to be tracked over Gaia or visually (use Hacking target number 12 to become invisible on Gaia).

## Using the autopilot
In small teams, players may choose to put the vehicle on autopilot. The autopilot can navigate around the city but at the first sign of danger it will stop somewhere safe. If the players want to stop that from happening then they must hack the autopilot first (Hacking, target number 12).

## Boarding
There is a long Icar tradition of jumping from one vehicle to another. If the pilot rams someone then anyone in the car may jump onto the other car with a successful skill check. Failing the skill check usually means dangling by the fingertips! The further the team is from the other vehicle, the more difficult the jump is.

# Hacking
Gaia is the 3D virtual world that acts as the internet in Icar. The whole human race revolves around the use of Gaia. For more details on Gaia itself (and the different objects you get in it), see the Gaia section in the Background.
Hacking is the act of performing illegal actions in Gaia. Gaia emulates the laws of the real world and so can be mistreated in a similar way. Hacking often requires a team effort, regardless of whether a Character has the Hacking Skill. 
When considering Gaia, it is best to think of it as the real world rather than a 21st Century computer system. If a message needs to travel through Gaia, you might assume it moves instantly (like email) and although it is instant, you can intercept the message still. Do not worry about the technical concerns here. The aim is to make Gaia playable without any in depth technical knowledge.
What Hacking is used for
Hacking can be used to support a team in Icar.  Hackers make use of specialized hacking programs called 'Hacking Entities', to help them achieve their goal. Most Hacking runs take more than one successful roll of the Hacking Skill. The number of times to roll depends on the difficulty of the task. Following is a selection of actions a Hacker can take, with examples of how many times to roll a Hacking Skill check.
Finding secured data
Breaking and entering into corporate and personal Gaia spaces is the best place to find juicy data. From Corporate systems you can grab employment records, lists of workers, secret plans for future projects, plans of the building layouts and even incriminating files. From personal Gaia Spaces, you can read 3D immersive diary entries, steal the contact information of friends and view their information.
To determine the number of Hacking Skill checks to pass, imagine you had to break into someone's house to steal their bank statements. You would need to break into the front door (1 roll), then into a locked box of personal items (1 roll). Therefore, you need to roll Hacking twice. Of course, the Hacker never really goes into the house physically but their Gaia Isis will go into the virtual space. If you want to change the information (i.e. their banking statements), you will need to pass another Hacking check.
Fixing sensors and cameras on a loop
In the more secure areas of Imperial space, there are many sensors and Cameras recording everything. To avoid being caught, you might want to Hack the cameras and sensors so that they stop recording and just record a loop of nothing changing.
To determine the number of Hacking Skill checks to pass, imagine you had to do this today in the real world. First, you would need to break into a security room in the building (1 roll) and then force the cameras to break their programming (1 roll). You might also need to destroy a security entity that is watching the camera feed (1 roll). You then need to use the Hacking Entity Looper (1 roll). Therefore, 4 Hacking Skill checks are needed.
Opening real world doors
Breaking into places involves either Hacking the door panel or cutting your way in. To open a real world door, the Hacker must roll just once. For getting access to a Spacecraft, the airlock will have two sets of controls, so you will need to Hack twice.
Accessing the Undergaia
The Undergaia is the name given to accidental fissures in Gaia, which most users cannot sense or locate. The Undergaia is useful for connecting with criminals, finding out restricted data, buying or selling information or hiding data and illegal Entities. More information on the Undergaia is provided in the Gaia section in the background later.
Hacking vehicles and spacecraft
It is possible to disrupt the systems on a Spacecraft or vehicle.  Spacecraft and vehicles have many Gaia Entities (intelligent programs) that automatically control many of the systems. A Hacker can disrupt these systems but only for a short period of time as the Entities will be regenerated by the systems they run. With luck, it is possible to shut down systems with Hacking entirely but it takes many successful rolls.
Vehicles
Vehicles use Entities for opening doors, navigating traffic, driving, maintaining power, gravity dampening fields (which removes g-forces), controlling shielding and a food and drinks bioreorganiser. 
To Hack into a Vehicle, you need to roll twice to get into the security and then once for each system you wish to disrupt. The system will be off in the next turn for that turn only.
If you manage to successfully roll 10 hacking rolls in a vehicle, all further system hacks will be permanent!
Spacecraft
Hacking Spacecraft is a much more difficult affair as a single Spacecraft has thousands of Entities with massive duplication  of effort. As such Hacking Spacecraft systems must be performed from inside or standing on the hull of the craft.
Hacking Augmented Humans
Humans with Cyberware can be hacked if they have a Gaia Link. Cheap bionics suits require 4 passes and expensive bionics suits may require 16 successful rolls of Hacking! Once inside, the Hacker can do all manner of damage, such as switching off the ability to walk or balance, any of the sensors. Bionic implants will not allow Hackers to kill the augmented human but they can be locked inside their own body by Hacking, needing a Medic with Bionics systems to be unlocked.
Hacking Entities
Hacking Entities are special Gaia Entities (intelligent programs) that subvert Gaia and can be used to help a Hacker achieve certain tasks. Hacking Entities each have a specific goal and can be purchased in the Undergaia. To bring a Hacking Entity to life, a successful Hacking roll is required. Some Hacking Entities have more requirements.
A full list of Hacking Entities is in the Technology Section but some examples are given here.
Back Door
Once you have hacked into a system, you can create a Back Door to let you (and anyone else) back in. Back Doors are Easy to find by other hackers or system administrators.
Generator Overloader
The Generator Overloader will set a Generator on a path of self-destruction. Small generators (in emergency lighting) take 60 seconds to overload, whereas large generators (such as in spacecraft) may take up to an hour.
Hacking during combat
Hackers can play their part during combat by changing the environment (opening or closing doors, switching off lights, opening air locks, turning off the gravity). The act of using Gaia is a physical one, a Hacker uses his hands, voice and whole body to control Gaia. Therefore, the amount of Hacking that can be performed in a single combat turn is determined by the Hacker's Shift statistic. A Hacker may roll for Hacking as many times as he has points in his Shift Statistic. 
If bionically augmented, then the number of rolls increases hugely as it is the augmented Shift statistic that is used, not the natural one.
Other useful Skills
Hacking has its limitations. As a Hacker, you might be excellent at breaking into systems but it does not allow you to do everything. In that case, you will need to use other Skills. If another member of the party has those Skills, they can join you on the Hacking run and can use their appropriate Skills when needed. Here are the most common Skills useful to the Hacker.
Forgery (Life Skill Tree)
Sometimes it is useful to change the things that you find. Improve school records, change employment records or frame someone with video footage.
Impersonation (Academic Skill Tree)
If a Hacker is found somewhere they should not be by another person then pretending you do belong can stop you from being thrown out. This will only work against humans or Security Entities with plenty of intelligence.
Space Combat
Combat in the pitch black void of space is dangerous. To survive, you will need a team (crew) able to fly, arm and repair the spacecraft. Space Combat is a team affair that concentrates on what the Characters are doing, rather than the location of the spacecraft. Maps are only useful for noting roughly where the combatants and astral objects are and where each are heading.
Unlike the rest of combat in Icar, each round is roughly 3 minutes long. That does not mean that weapons fire slowly (the rounds per turn are the same) but you only get one chance to shoot a gun in a 3 minutes block. It is a simplification that makes play more fun.
When entering space combat, it is very important to understand what the aim of the team is: either fight or flee. If you fight, you have the opportunity to destroy systems on any opposing spacecraft. If you flee, you cannot pick and choose what you destroy. You can change this aim at the start of each round.
Spacecraft Combat Initiative
Every spacecraft has a Combat Initiative rating. This rating represents how well suited the spacecraft is for combat. Factors that affect the Combat Initiative include sensors, size, shape, where the generators are, how well armoured the bridge is and thousands of small details that contribute to the spacecraft as being combat effective. Fighters and smaller spacecraft tend to have a higher Combat Initiative. Combat Initiative is not about speed, manouvring or number of guns (which is covered elsewhere), it is about the space craft's suitability through design.
Combat Initiative is 0 or higher and is added to the Initiative roll made at the start of each turn.
Roles of the team
The crew on-board a spacecraft have a role.  The roles are stations such as; Operations, Pilot, Gunner and Engineer. There can be only one Operations and Pilot but there can be many Gunners and Engineers. During a space combat turn, each of these stations should be filled. The aim is ensure that all the players are busy during combat.
Operations
Operations keeps track of the tactical situation and organises the crew, usually the Captain of the spacecraft. Anyone can perform the Operations station, but it is best suited for someone with a high Wit and Battle Attributes.
In game terms, the Operations role is responsible for rolling Initiative. Having a good initiative means that you're beginning the turn in a beneficial state.
Pilot
The Pilot is responsible for manoeuvring the craft so that the gunners can shoot specific systems. The Pilot must have the Combat Cruiser Skill. The Pilot Cruiser Skill only allows the crew to flee. If you need the craft's Artificial Intelligence to fly then surrender!
In game terms, the Pilot must put the craft in a position such that the Gunners can fire at specific systems on the enemy.
Gunners
Gunners man the weapon stations and do damage to the enemy. As Artificial Intelligence systems cannot do harm, it is humans that must fire the weapons. A spacecraft can have as many Gunners as it has weapon entries on its record sheet. A Gunner needs the Heavy Weapons Skill to fire the guns.
Engineers
Engineers make sure that the craft stays in one piece. During combat, Engineers move around the craft fixing system that were targeted by the enemy. To be an Engineer, a Character must have the Spacecraft Systems Skill (or Colony/Weapon/Vehicle Systems at -30%).
Optional Rule - Multiple Roles
Operations or an Engineer may fire guns. However, an Engineer may not fire guns and repair in the same turn. There is no setting justification for this, it makes small crews viable and is more fun!
Space Combat Turn Sequence
The GM will begin space combat by drawing a rough map of the locations of the objects and what their intentions are. Some may be turning to attack, others may be fleeing or innocent bystanders caught in the melee. Each each step in the combat, each combatant does that action, the highest Initiative goes last. This is so that the highest initiative gets a chance to see what the enemy is doing.
Operations Rolls Initiative
Operations rolls: 
Spacecraft Combat Initiative + Battle + Wit + D10
Then each of the combatants are arranged in ladder with the highest roll at the top. Attacking targets with a higher initiative give a negative bonus of -20% to pilot manoeuvring. 
Fight or Flee?
The players then decide whether to fight or flee. This is a team decision but the Operations crew member has the final say.  A turn is 3 minutes, so there is time for discussion.
Fight
When you decide to fight, you get to choose specific systems on an enemy to target. It is much easier to disable a craft by picking systems. 
Choose targets
Once you have decided to fight, you then choose the system on the target ships you want to attack. You can attack as many ships as you have weapon entries on the record sheet and gunners operating them. If you have 2 guns but only one gunner, you can only shoot one gun. This is a team decision but the Operations crew member gets the final say.
Pilot manoeuvre check
The pilot now needs to get the craft into the correct position so the gunners can shoot at the systems you want to hit. Every spacecraft has a manouvre modifier, which you add to your Skill. If you are attacking a craft with a higher initiative, modify your Skill by -20%.
Skill check: Combat Cruiser + Manouvre Modifier + Higher initiative modifier
If successful, the Gunners can shoot the target system you picked without a negative modifier.
Gunners
Each of the Gunners roll to hit a specific system on the target Spacecraft. Each Spacecraft has a list of systems that can be shot at. Next to each system is a % modifier called the Target System Modifier (it is listed simply as % on the Spacecraft record sheet). If the pilot failed the Pilot manouvre check, modify your skill by an extra -20%.
To see if you hit, roll the Skill check:
Skill check: Heavy Firing + Target System Modifier + Pilot manouvre success
If you are shooting something other than a shield (which requires a single energy round), remove the Ammo in the Rounds per Turn (R/T) column for each gun fired from the 'Ammo Onboard' box.
If you are Fleeing, a Gunner may only shoot at Shields and Hull.
All shooting occurs simultaneously, so if another craft shoots out your guns just before you get a chance to fire, you still get to shoot this turn and hope the engineers can repair the damage for next turn.
Fleeing
If the fight isn't going well, the crew may want to flee. To flee you need to choose Flee at the start of three consecutive turns.
After three turns of trying to flee, you can determine if it is possible. If your craft has a Point to Point (PTP) Light Jump or a Curve Surf engine then you may jump to another system, leaving the combat. If your craft does not have PTP then you have to outrun them on Grav. To do that, the spacecraft needs to have a Manoeuvre score equal or larger than your pursuer. Otherwise, you are going to have to fight or surrender.
While fleeing, the Gunners may fire at any targets but may not select a system. This is because selecting a system requires you to be in the right position and fleeing is not about getting into the right position but getting away fast. If the Grav Engine is knocked out then no fleeing can be done until it is repaired. Once repaired, the three turns of fleeing must begin again.
Engineers Repair
It is the job of the Engineers to repair damaged systems. Engineers cannot replace shields or Hull damage during combat, but they can repair other systems. To repair a damaged system: do a Spacecraft Systems check: 
Skill check: Spacecraft Systems
When a system has taken catastrophic damage (see below) it cannot be repaired and must be replaced in a Star Dock.
Combat Over?
If there are no more targets then the combat is over. Otherwise, a new turn begins. The GM will update the locations of the craft on the map and initiative is rolled again.
Taking Damage
Shields
Before any damage is done to the Spacecraft, the shields must be depleted. The number of shields are listed on the spacecraft record sheet. A shield lasts an entire turn and protects from all damage during that turn. Once it goes down, the next pops up until they are depleted. Shields can only be damaged by an Energy Weapon, but it only takes a single round.
Hull
When shooting the hull, take the number from the Dmg/T box on the spacecraft weapon and add it to a running total in the Damage Taken disc.
Targeted Systems
If a Targeted System is hit by a gunner then strike a line through it to show that it cannot be used until fixed by an Engineer. Hull damage is also taken when a targeted system is shot at.
Accumulated Damage
When the Damage Taken exceeds a damage level on the chart then that system is inoperable and cannot be fixed without a Star Dock. 
For example: In the Crowthorne damage chart above damage is measured in thousands. If the Spacecraft takes 100,000 points of damage then a Generator is damaged. After 140,000 points of accumulated damage, the Shield Generator is damaged and so on.
Catastrophic Damage
Catastrophic damage occurs when a spacecraft system is hit in two separate turns without an engineer repairing it inbetween. Catastrophic damage means that the system must be replaced in a repair facility.
Space Combat Tactics
Space Comabt in Icar is a different to other space opera combat systems and it breeds a different kind of tactic. It is difficult to know exactly under what circumstance you should fight, flee or surrender.
You get to see the stats of the enemy
Spacecraft cannot hide their abilities, even the most basic sensor scans can give you enough information to see the contents of the enemy's spacecraft record sheet.
Bigger space craft are not always better
Having a lot of hull hit points does not make you invicible because Space Combat in Icar is not a battle of attrition. A smaller craft with a highly trained crew and three gun clusters can disable a larger craft quite easily. Weigh up the enemy's spacecraft record sheet against yours carefully before you decide to flee.
The difference in shields means free shots
When you enter a combat, weigh up the difference in between your shields and theirs. You can think of this difference as the number of free attacks. If you have 10 shields and they have 3, you can have 7 turns of shooting them without them being able to damage your systems. 
If you are in a small craft with few crew, then you can take out lots of their systems without any worry of damage.
Weapons or Grav Engine first
On slower enemies, it is usually better to shoot out the weapons. On quicker enemies, it is usually better to shoot out the Grav Engine. A spacecraft that cannot shoot in a combat is doomed. One that cannot shoot or run away should surrender.
Have an exit strategy with repair in mind
Before you jump into a fight (assuming it's not sprung on you), check out the Cluster map and ensure that there is a place where you can get to quickly to repair if you need to flee. Keep in mind that some Star Docks might not appreciate you fighting with spacecraft they have a service contract with.
Remember that your enemy can follow you when you flee with a light jump and although you might be quicker, if you are in a Star Dock, you are vulnerable.
Ammunition is expensive
A single round of 20 guage (20G) pulse laser ammunition is common but exceptionally expensive. To destroy the hull of a very large space craft would be extremely costly. Taking out a system is much cost effective.
Surrender options
Surrending may not be the end! If an enemy surrenders, then  make the best out of their cargo. A surrendering crew must not be trusted, especially if the losing crew are going to become hostages. If you manage to get onboard the spacecraft of a victorious enemy, consider attacking from inside.
Space Combat Example
In this example, two spacecraft are pitted against each other. You can find the space craft in the Equipment index but we will deal with general details here. Only two turns are dealt with here as example. The crew of the two spacecraft are:

Gaterunner (the smaller craft)
Captained by Simon (Operations Role, Battle = 7, Wit = 8) with gunner Gideon (Heavy Firing 70%), pilot Peter (Combat Cruiser 60%) and Engineer Andrew (Spacecraft Systems 70%). This is the player Character spacecraft. The Gaterunner has only one shield left, a Combat Initiative of and a Manouvre Modifier of +30.
Cyclone (the much, much larger craft)
Captained by Kathryn (Operations Role, Battle = 7, Wit = 5 ) with gunners Sarah (Heavy Firing 75%) and Louise (Heavy Firing 70%), flown by Matilda (Combat Cruiser 60%) and Engineer Constance (Spacecraft Systems 40%). This is the non-player Character spacecraft. The Cyclone has only one shield left, a Combat Initiative of +1 and Manouvre Modifier of +10.
Turn 1 - Operations roll initiative
Kathryn and Simon  roll initiative:
Combat Initiative + Battle + Wit + D10
Kathryn rolls 7, giving a initiative of 20 (1+7+5+7=20). Simon rolls 6, giving an initiative of 24 (3+7+8+6=24). Therefore the Gaterunner goes first and the Cyclone crew suffer a modifier of -20% to the Pilot manouvre check.
Turn 1 - Fight or Flee?
The Cyclone crew are forced to decide first as they have the lower initiative. Based on the size of their craft, they decide to fight.
The players decide to fight as they have the benefit of winning the initiative and their shields protect them for at least this turn. Having shields means that you do not need to decide to flee just yet.
Turn 1 - Pick Targets
The Gaterunner has shields up, they cannot choose a specific system to fire up, so the Cyclone crew choose to shoot at the Hull.
As the Cyclone has shields up, the players choose to shoot at the hull, giving the same modifier.
Turn 1 - Pilots Manoeuvre
Matilda, the Cyclone Pilot, rolls Combat Cruiser Skill check. As the are attacking a spacecraft with a higher initiative, Matilda subtracts 20% from her Skill of 60%. The Cyclone has a manouvre rating of +10%. She needs to roll under 50% (60 - 20 + 10). She rolls 54, which is a fail. The two Cyclone gunners will be shooting with a -20% modifier.
Peter, the player pilot, has Combat Cruiser at 60%. As Peter is manouvring against a spacecraft with a lower initiative, he gets no negative modifier. He adds the Gaterunner's manouvring of 30% to his still of 60%. He must roll under 90%. He rolls D100 and gets 25. Therefore, his successful piloting has allowed the player gunner to shoot without a negative modifier.
Turn 1 - Gunners Shoot
The Cyclone crew shoot at the hull of the Gaterunner. The Cyclone has 2 guns and the crew has two gunners. As the Cyclone pilot failed the roll, they must subtract 20% from their Skills. They get two shots, on for each weapon on the spacecraft record sheet. 
Sarah has a Heavy Firing Skill of 75% but must subtract 20% because the pilot manouvre check failed. She rolls a D100 and gets 60%, which is a miss. Louise fires has a Heavy Firing Skill of 70% and must subtract 20% too. She rolls 18, which is a hit. The single shot is enough to shut down the last Gaterunner shield (they only had one left). No ammo is removed because they are shooting at the shields.
Now Gideon can use the guns of the Gaterunner to fire. Shields only need one round to be taken down, so he fires one shot, rolling D100. The target is 90% - his Skill Heavy Firing 70%. He rolls 47, which is under. The last Cyclone shield goes down. As Gideon is the only gunner, the Gaterunner crew only get one shot.
Turn 1 - Engineers repair
The Cyclone has not taken any damage yet.
The Gaterunner has not taken any damage either, so Andrew the Engineer is probably yelling about the shields being out and how they need to flee.
Turn 1 - Is combat over?
Not yet! No-one has fled or surrendered. So it is onto turn 2.
Turn 2 - Operations roll initiative
Kathryn and Simon roll initiative:
Combat Initiative + Battle + Wit + D10
Kathryn rolls 2, giving a initiative of 15 (1+7+5+2=15). Simon rolls 8, giving an initiative of 26 (3+7+8+8=26). Therefore the Gaterunner wins again and the Cyclone crew suffer a modifier of -20% to the Pilot Manouvring check.
Turn 2 - Fight or Flee?
The Cyclone crew lost the initiative so will be going first again through this turn. Being the bigger craft, they decide to fight.
The Gaterunner crew decide to fight too. Why? Because they are players and while they have the initiative, the chance of doing system damage to the Cyclone is high.
Turn 2 - Pick Targets
As shields are down, the Cyclone crew elect to shoot at the Hull again. The Gaterunner's hull is not very strong, so they believe taking it out might force them to surrender.
The players decide to shoot out one of the pulse laser guns, evening up the fight.
Turn 2 - Pilots Manoeuvre
Matilda, the Cyclone Pilot, rolls Combat Cruiser, with -20% for attacking a crafter with a better initiative and +10% for the Cyclone's manouvring. She rolls 60, which is a fail.
Peter, the Gaterunner pilot, rolls Pilot Cruiser with the Gaterunner's +30% manouvring modifier and rolls 14, which is a pass.
Turn 2 - Gunners Shoot

The Cyclone gunners shoot at the hull of the Gaterunner. Their pilot failed the manouvring roll, so they reduce their Heavy Firing Skill checks by 20%. 
Both the gunners pass their Heavy firing rolls and do 8000 points to the hull of the player's Gaterunner. The Gaterunner crew add 8000 into 'damage taken'. This damage does not hurt the Gaterunner. Their damage needs to get to 30,000 points before they take noticeable damage - a generator.
Gideon, the Gaterunner gunner, shoots at the Pulse Laser on the Cyclone. The Pulse Laser system on the Spacecraft record sheet has a modifier of -20%. He rolls 23, which is under the 30% he needs (70% Skill with -20% modifier). The system is crossed out and 2000 is put into the Cyclone's 'damage taken' semi circle.
Turn 2 - Engineers repair
The Cyclone has a damaged Pulse Laser, so the Cyclone Engineer Constance rolls against her Spacecraft Systems of 40% to attempt a repair. She rolls 51, so the weapon remains inoperative.
The Gaterunner has taken hull damage but this requires a Space Dock to fix.
Turn 2 - Is combat over?
No-one is fleeing and there isn't any sign of surrender. So combat continues.
Turn 3 - Operations roll initiative
Kathryn and Simon roll initiative:
Combat Initiative + Battle + Wit + D10
Kathryn rolls 9, giving a initiative of 21 (1+7+5+9=21). Simon rolls 2, giving an initiative of 20 (3+7+8+2=20). The Cyclone wins and the players will suffer a modifier of -20% to the Pilot Manouvring check.
Turn 3 - Fight or Flee?
The players must decide what they are going to do first and have been rattled by the damage done by the Cyclone guns. The Cyclone has only one gun now, so they are only doing 4000 points of damage a turn. That leaves them plenty of time but they are no risk takers, so decide to flee.
This is an option because the Gaterunner Manoeuvre rating is +30, which is larger than the  Cyclone Manoeuvre of +10.
The Cyclone is going to chase them down.
Turn 3 - Pick Targets
As the players are fleeing, they can only shoot at the hull. Ammunition is expensive and their weapons are do not do enough damage to the Cyclone to make it worthwhile, so they will not fire. Gideon (the Gaterunner's gunner) will help Andrew (the Engineer) as he has Energy System skill at 50%.
The Cyclone crew decide to try and shoot out the Gaterunner's Grav Engine with both guns to try and stop them from running away.
Turn 3 - Pilots Manoeuvre
Peter has a Combat Pilot of 80%, his modifiers are -20% for attacking a craft with a higher initiative and +30% for the manouvring of the Gaterunner. With modifiers, he needs to roll under 90%. He rolls 98, which is a fail.
Matilda rolls 21, which is under her Combat Cruiser Skill of 60%, even without the manouvring bonus from the Cyclone of +10%. Her gunners can now shoot at the Grav Engine with a modifier from her.
Turn 3 - Gunners Shoot

The Cyclone only has one gun, the other was damaged last turn and the repair roll failed. Sarah is the better shot so takes control of it. The Cyclone team (the GM) decides that the Gaterunner is not allowed to escape and so they elect to try and shoot out its propulsion - the Grav Engine. This carries a -30% modifier.
Sarah needs to roll under 45 (Skill is 75% with a -30 modifier). She does not manage it and no damage is done to the Gaterunner at all - not even to the hull.
Turn 3 - Engineers repair
The Cyclone still has a damaged Pulse Laser, so the Engineer Constance has a second attempt at fixing it by rolling against her Spacecraft Systems of 40%. She rolls 31, so the weapon is fixed and the line through it is rubbed out. From now on both Sarah and Louise may fire.
Turns 4 and 5
For the next two turns, the players keep electing to flee and the Cyclone keeps trying to knock out the Grav engine on the Gaterunner but fail. At the end of the 5th turn, the Gaterunner has fled for 3 turns in a row, so combat is over. The Gaterunner  may now light jump or head off into another part of the system.
