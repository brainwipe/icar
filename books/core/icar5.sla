With the Droid advance halted, human occupied space is a trove of opportunity for the Characters to explore. There are no intelligent alien species, travel between the stars is commonplace, friendly robots called Automatons live as slaves and family members, corporations are duplicitous villains, and a virtual quasi-reality internet called Gaia is both the backbone of civilisation and the playground of hackers."/>

                <ITEXT CH="Icar is set in 92028 AD, the human race is spread across space and is ruled by a benevolent government called the Imperium. Another race of sentient robots called Ã¯Â¿Â½The DroidsÃ¯Â¿Â½, inhabit the galaxy and are a dire threat to humanity. The Droids were originally created to dispose of a strain of zombie humans. The Droids then turned against all of humanity, waging a successful campaign of death and destruction until 1,000 years ago, when they began an internal  civil war. The Droids are no longer a single race with a single purpose and so humanity has been saved - for the time being.
