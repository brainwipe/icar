This is utterly frustrating. [Lulu](http://www.icar.co.uk) have failed to print Icar again. Each time I lose a week waiting for them to try and print, fail, wait 3 days for feedback, then do an update to the PDF and so on. Months are rolling by and there is nothing I can do.  

I had to first make sure the background went up to the bleed edge. No probs. Then I had to flatten the transparencies. Then I had to use their print profile. Then I had to remove all the vector art and replace it with rasterised versions. Now it still won't print.  

They keep telling me that I have too many high res images but that would suggest that any roleplaying game with high res images won't print. I'm at the end of my tether with Lulu, who politely tell me that my PDF is wrong - not that they could be doing anything wrong. Not that they offer a service incorrectly. It appears you can't print Hi Res documents with Lulu.
