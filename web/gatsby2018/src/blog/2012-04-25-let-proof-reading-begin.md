A quick flick through has shown that there are some layout problems but I was expecting that. For example, the white box behind the text could do with being a little bit more opaque - or at least blend in such a way to keep a good contrast between it and the text. Not having a printer at home has made experimentation difficult.  

Now I will engage the Mrs to perform a spot of proof reading. You might think of it as free but I imagine that I will be doing the washing up for months to come!
