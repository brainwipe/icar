          <h1>Virtual Session</h1>
          <p>
            Back in 2000, I asked a player to bring his digital camera along to
            a session of The Fear to record a typical evening playing. This is
            for the players who were there, the girlfriends who wonder what the
            hell we do each Tuesday evening and for religious cultists to gather
            evidence of witchcraft.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Fear were an incredibly good group, that created their niches
            quickly and gelled easily. The background of the group were
            vigilantes operating in Dorian, on a planet called Acerine Prime. As
            a group, they were often brutal and quick to make decisions, but
            whatever they did, it was done in style. The requisite 5 players
            showed some very different styles of play:
          </p>

          <h2>The Players</h2>
          <ul className="players">
            <li>
              <h3>
                Fish
              </h3>
              <img src={fish} alt="Fish, Simon Aubury" />
              Playing Icar since year dot, his character began working at right
              angles with the team. He essentially used the team for profit for
              half of the game. He also used his extensive self-created
              connections to aid the team, but they never really trusted him
              after they found out half their decent contacts were Fish's
              character is disguise and half the trouble they were in was his
              fault! Quite often, the players would joke that Fish was the one
              telling Rob (the GM) the plotlines. This wasn't always true.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>
                Pete
              </h3>
              <img src={pete} alt="Pete" />
              The Fear didn't have a leader. They had Pete, the driving force
              and style guru. Stubborness and style beyond normal human
              parameters, Pete was responsible for the team staying alive
              <em>and looking cool while they did it</em>. So miuch style, in
              fact, that Pete had to create new firing skills to meet his desire
              for style.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>
                Byrnie
              </h3>
              <img src={byrnie} alt="Byrnie" />
              Byrnie was the team diplomat (in 2012, he still is). No matter
              what the argument was between the rest of the group, Byrnie could
              find the middle ground. He could find the middle ground of a
              sphere, come to think of it. The only time Byrnie failed was when
              Pete's donkey-like stubborness kicked in. Byrn was responsible for
              taking many of the photos here, so thanks to him!
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>
                Dwain
              </h3>
              <img src={dwain} alt="Dwain" />
              Any team needs an argument engine and Dwain was it. Any side of
              the argument that could be taken, he take it, often switching
              sides half-way through. His Icar experience was excellent as well,
              allowing seemingly cast-iron, but essentially pointless arguments
              to hold ground against the rest of the team. His character was
              quite often attributed to saving the group / planet / system.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>
                Tamas
              </h3>
              <img src={tamas} alt="Tamas" />
              Tamas played Icar on a completely different level to the rest of
              the team. His blinding intelligence and ability to think plots
              through in the minutae of detail allowed him to perplex the rest
              of the team with possibilities and consequences of their actions.
              This suits Icar quite well, but reduced the amount that could be
              achieved in a session due to the weighing of numerous
              possibilities.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Rob</h3>
              <img src={rob} alt="Rob" />
              The GM. Me. With big hair. The one who put up with the other
              lunatics for 3 hours a week.
