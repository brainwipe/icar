Having added a lot of graphics to the Alpha, I thought it was time to update the one on the website. As you can see, I'm trying to keep the quality of the graphics to a high standard. If there are any of the images that you think lower the tone of the overall document, then please let me know on the forums. As there hasn't been an update since May, I thought it best to show that I am working on it still and there is progress, albeit in my spare time and slow! Much of the new artwork (see bottom of left hand bar) and equipment (that pops up in the new files box on the right) was created such that I could have new graphics for the rules so if you see new pictures popping up, then they're probably for the ruleset.

You might also have noticed the new Star Maps for the four Sectors. Four? Four! Yes, four. The three human occupied space sectors and Typhon, which is a Droid held sector. The campaign I am running at the moment is based there, so I thought I'd upload it too. The other maps are currently included in the Society book but the maps are black-based and so are difficult to print and annotate with your own cluster names. These (hopefully) are easier to use, although I might make them a little lighter for those printing onto a laser printer.

I am debating (with myself, out loud, on the train to work) whether or not to release another setting. I have 3 half finished settings: Star Fleet Special Forces, Star Enforcer and Benedict Corporation (working title). The one nearest completion is the Star Fleet Setting. If you think this is a good thing and I should just push the damn setting out ASAP, then let me know on the forums.

Also worth mentioning is the new Society book. This background document is very short and is in need of updating. I have been modifying it and adding text (particularly about corporations and the Akarak Nation). Would you all like to see an Alpha of that or are you happy for me to just throw out a new version when it's done. As it has very few rules in it (a bit about space travel speeds and star maps), it does not really need to be playtested.

That's all from me at the moment. Over the Christmas period, you can expect some more updates as I have quite a bit of holiday on the way.
