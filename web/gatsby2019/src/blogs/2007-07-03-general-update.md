General Update, although a superior officer of Major Update, isn't quite as fun packed. Just to let you know what's been going on and what progress there is.

## My Campaign Finished

This might not seem important but whenever I finish a campaign game, I have to write a new setting. This means, of course, that the old setting gets mothballed but a new one is written. The settings tend to be quite involved from the player point of view but a bit light from the GM point of view - most of my notes are written down by hand so I can have them at the game session. I may write up the old setting document, or just release the next one. The next setting will be playing part of the Anarchic Syndicate "Tortrac Heds". Something of a departure for the team, who normally play good guys.

## Equipment Index Version 6

I have a love/hate affair with the Equipment Index. I love the idea of a PDF file that has all the weapon/vehicle sheets in them so they can be easily printed in one go but the PDF compression does something nasty to the JPG images, which makes the text difficult to read. I could convert then all across to nice-and-sharp PDF pages but that would take me a considerable amount of time! Instead, the Equipment Index will be much like the existing one, a list of the information included on the sheets, a description of how to use some of the sheets and then all those items of equipment that don't really need a sheet but should be included somewhere. The big sections to go into here are Explosives, Automatons and Armour (both powered and standard).

## Why does it take so long?

Graphics. Compiling the graphics for Society and the Bionics book are taking their time. I have done a lot of the Bionics graphics, so that's going rather well. A lot of the objects that I need for Society exist, I just need to compile them into a series of scenes to demonstrate items in the text.

I know it's taking forever, thanks for your patience up until now, I hope you can keep it up!
