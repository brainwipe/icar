Something of a milestone has just been hit! All the re-renders for the new Equipment Index have been complete. You can download it from [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v;pid=explorer;chrome=true;srcid=0B2ThEbOVGt78YzQ4MjQ1NGEtNDdmYS00MDQwLWJkMWMtYTM3M2ExMmFhYTFi;hl=en). 

It has been something of a struggle to replace old models and re-render them with shiney new textures but now they are done, I'm thrilled with the end result. The new equipment index is compatible with the old one but you'll find the statistics have changed along with the pictures. Also, I have replaced all the discs with simple numbers. Numbers in circles, naturally but numbers nonetheless!

I am now working on the Technology section of the core rules - which is actually a quick reference for the equipment index for those people who don't want to print out all the hand-outs. Although I think that's a bit sad, I understand that some people just want to write down the statistics. Now that all the models are remade and skinned, it is a much quicker process. I hope to have another version of the core rules Alpha out in the middle of May.
