## SHODDY WARNING!

It's taken me a few years to get into a state that's releasable: the _Alpha_ of the Icar Version 4 book is now [ready for download](http://www.maison-de-stuff.net/rob/icar/icarv4a.pdf) (there's no preview for big PDFs on Google just yet, you have to download it). It's far from finished and the Alpha tag is there to warn you that it's still in a shoddy state but there is something to review.

## What sort of feedback I would like?

If you are keen to read Icar and give a little feedback, please come over to the [forum on 1km1kt](http://www.1km1kt.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=34). There you will find [a thread](http://www.1km1kt.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=34;t=2494) to feedback on. Don't worry about reading everyone else's feedback, I will sort through it all together. There is a load of things I know to be missing, so check that out first.
