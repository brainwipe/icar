> 2019 update - sadly, the wiki was hacked just 6 months later and was lost.

There's a bit of break happening with the rules at the moment due to some other commitments I've got. However, I managed to quickly set up a Wiki to keep hold of the quickly growing wealth of information. The reason the Wiki is good is that it is easy to update. If am stuck for something to do one lunchtime, I can go and pen a bit more about Icar without having to repaginate any PDFs or the like.

Another added benefit is that some of the more regular players can also add to the Wiki, making it a central source of information. Of course, this will mean that information might need to be updated in two places (both book and wiki) but I think that the use of each will be quite different. The Society book is very much an overview of everything that the GM and player needs to play within the Icar universe. The wiki has more in-depth information, right down to the very people in the Universe. I think this might be invaluable for GM and player research in the future. I have already started by adding some additional Akarak detail into the Wiki for my current campaign.

Please leavequestions and comments about the wiki in the Forums. I'd really like to hear what you think
