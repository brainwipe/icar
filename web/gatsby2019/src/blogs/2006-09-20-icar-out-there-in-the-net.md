Any game designer will tell you that getting their game noticed is really difficult. There are some wonderful games out there that are given little truck. So, it's nice to get some recognition.
		
RPG Blog, a very popular blog has featured Icar and there are some very pleasant comments on there too. RPG Blog has a universal appeal because it does not lean towards any particular area of gaming. One to check.

Dominus Nox on [The RPG Site](http://www.therpgsite.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1935) has plugged the cartoon, which is rather nice of him (or her). Now that the Elements 3.5 is up on the site in its graphically finished state, I can return to the story and follow the lives of Reg, Bakarak, Eric and Bob in the Scavenger setting.

A review page? I have contacted Golgotha, writer of the Midian RPG, thanking him for his review of the 3.4 version of the Elements and let him know that I fixed the things he thought needed fixing with the rules. I'm going to be creating a page of reviews, hopefully garnering some new reviews for version 3.5 (so I can fix any more issues and upload 3.6). Thanks to Golgotha for letting me add his review onto there.
