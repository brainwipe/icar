I have been reading and downloading other Free RPGs for quite a long time now and it occurred to me that there was no blog for reviewing and commenting on these free RPGs. So I have created [The Free RPG Blog](https://www.thefreerpgblog.com). A place to collect and highlight all the philanthropic goodness out there. Please do check it out and give comments where need be.
		
While on the subject, another blog I rather like to read called the [RPG Blog II](https://www.rpgblog2.com/) by Zachary Houghton, a rather well respected sort of fellow. The post "Quick 6: Games I Never To Get Play" listed Icar as one of its posts, to which he said:

>    Icar deserves better than this. Rob Lang has put several metric tons of work into creating one of the most impressive Sci-Fi RPG compilations I've seen--and its amazingly free. But with a backlog of roughly 17 other space/sci-fi RPGs pushing for playing time simultaneously, I feel like Rob's baby doesn't get the attention it richly deserves. We've got to work out some sort of rotation system for space and sci-fi campaign ideas/system proposals in our group. Custody every other weekend, perhaps?

I do hope he manages to run a game and let me know how it might be improved! Many thanks, Zach.
