The lovely people over at the [All Games Considered](http://allgamesconsidered.blogspot.com/2007_09_01_archive.html) podcast have done a feature on Icar (Early September this year) in their podcast under the 'Gaming for Cheap Bastards' (fantastic title). It's an excellent round up of the game and its mechanics. Much better than I have ever managed to do. I dip into RPG podcasts on an irregular basis (although I've just bought my first MP3 player, so that's already changing) so it was nice (and shocking) to hear it mentioned.

The critique is very constructive. Chris Heim (while ill, what a star) outlined some things that I've been bothered about. The most obvious one is that Soceity needs more work to better explain the general setting. That definitely something that's been niggling. Hearing it over the podcast lit a light, so it's definitely going to get revised. Oh and with more pictures.

Anyway, hearing (or reading) a constructive review or getting an email is all I need to be inspired to write a load more, improve it and plow on in the dark winter nights.

Go and give the whole thing a listen, there are some other great nuggest in RPG podcasts. Many thanks All Games Considered!

*Details:* Episode 60 [MP3](http://media.libsyn.com/media/tashkal/20070915AGC-64k.mp3) between 12 min 20secs to 21 min 10 secs, but listen to it all because it's all good. (Thanks Joeyeti!)
