I'm heavily editing the text of Icar for version 5 and by doing so, I'm trying to do the following:

- Make it easier to read
- Provide more hooks for the GM
- Provide more ideas for the players

With that in mind, I thought it might be fun to demonstrate _how_ I'm going about editing it by using a syndicate description - in this case the venerable Technomages as an example.

Technomages

- Technologist, 10 billion members
- Aim to spread the knowledge of technological invention
- Across all Human Occupied Space
- Ruling Technomages based in Turus cluster (home of Star Fleet)
- They remain secret from the general public
- Star Enforcers think them mostly harmless, only when the inventions become a danger to the public do they get involved. 
- The more dangerous and illegal their field of invention, the further underground a Technomage cell will be.
- Star Enforcers occasionally use the Technomages for information, in exchange for turning a blind eye.
- Technomages are organised geographically into clans and then by technology field into cells. 
- A Technomage has a numbered rank and awards for aiding other Technomages, innovating or helping out the general public using Technology.
- Each mage wears a blue strip of digital cloth called a Mobius, which shows membership and standing. Black bands wrapped across one end represent rank and celestial objects represent awards and achievements.
- Relatively easy to find through Undergaia, good for custom technology, upgrades to spacecraft, weapons, vehicles, bionics etc.
- Good for mission hooks

Technomages
The Technomages are a syndicate spread across Human Occupied Space with 10 million members. Their aim is to spread knowledge and love of technological innovation. They are secret from the general public and the Star Enforcers regard them as mostly harmless, stepping in only when the inventions become a danger to society. The more dangerous the field of invention, the more careful and underground the Technomages will be.

Technomages are organised hierarchically, their leadership being based in Turus cluster, Sayshell (home of Star Fleet). They are grouped together geographically into clans and each clan is split in cells of 50 people. A Technomage has a numbered rank and receives awards for helping other technomages, long service, innovation or helping out the general public with technology. Each Technomage wears a blue strip of digital cloth called a Mobius, which shows membership and standing. Black bands wrapped across one end represent rank and celestial objects represent awards and achievements.

Technomages are common, easy to find through Undergaia, good for custom technology, upgrades to spacecraft, weapons, vehicles, bionics, etc. Their payment is often cheap but there is a possibility that you will be shopped into the Star Enforcers. On occasion, Technomages will come looking for help, they aren't a rich syndicate but they can offer cool technology in return.
