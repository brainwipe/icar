Completely out of the blue, Kitkatman from [Salroth: The Chronicles](http://salroth.com/forums/index.php), emailled me to ask if he can run Icar over on the Salroth forums. I was flattered (and surprised). He's now in the process of uploading the whole equipment index to their Gallery (good luck to him!). He's being very careful to credit the design back to the site, which fills me with a lot of confidence. The quality of the other games going on at Salroth is high but centre less on the long prose of the [Desert Realm](http://www.desertrealm.com/forum/). In general, Salroth is well worth a look, so pop on over for a nose around.

Of course, if you fancy playing the PBP version of Icar, just wait a few days for Kitkatman to get his house in order and I am sure you'll be allowed to join in. Many thanks to him for taking an interest and good luck with the game!
