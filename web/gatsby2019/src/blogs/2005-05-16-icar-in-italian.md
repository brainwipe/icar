No-one would have ever predicted that Icar would be translated into Italian. But it has. *Paulo Longoni* has spent an incredible amount of time translating Icar into Italian!

The rule version is 3.4 (Italian 1.1) and it is available in PDF format from the website. Even though I do not read Italian, the quality of the typesetting and the fact that he's managed to get all the graphics together is _staggering_. I don't know of any Free RPGs that have been translated into another language, so I am thrilled to bits!

Even if you don't speak Italian, pop over to his site to check it out. It's simple wonderful and I am sitting here shaking with joy that someone would put the effort in to do this. I hope he can get some players together to play it!! :) Alternatively, stop by the Forums and congratulate him on a job well done. The amount of work is considerable and I think we should all applaud this wonderful effort.

(No doubt he'll add the 3.5 rules when they go through into the Beta stage - not worth it at the moment)
