Thanks to Golgotha, I have put up a Reviews page, with just the one review at the moment. It's a little long in the tooth, being of Version 3.4 but it's quite nice to see that I've sorted out some of the pRob Langlems he outlined. Now onto Society. If you have a comment or a full blown review and you would recommend Icar enough to have it listed here, please do [contact me](mailto:roblang@icar.co.uk) and I'll add your review.

## Society Alpha Next...

The Society document increases in size by the week. Fortunately, I have lots of 3D models I made for the Elements that do show and describe things in the Society (background) document. I can render and reuse all these objects to better describe things in Icar. Recently, [The Wicked Flea](http://groups.google.com/group/icarrpg/browse_frm/thread/efe5174a6b04ecee/) got in touch and noted that there isn't much on The Akarakians in the current book, this is certainly not the case in Soceity 2! Also, I will be adding to the number of settings in the near future. Society 2 really does need to be first.

## Vendetta

A big well done to Andrew (Byrnie) O'Byrne for his latest Burntek weapon, the Vendetta. It's a monster! Icar of old used to have loads of multi-weapons and now it has only a few. If you can find, afford and carry one, you'll find it an excellent addition to your armoury.

## Toon

The Icartoon (gettit?) is still being updated and after a brief hiatus, it is back. I'm throwing them out about once a week at the moment. Normally midweek. The situations you see in cartoon might be familiar to some!

## Other site updates

I've updated the (links.xml)links] sections and will be changing the links on the front page shortly to better reflect sites that I am interested in at the moment!
