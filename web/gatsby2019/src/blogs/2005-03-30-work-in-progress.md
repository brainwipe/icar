Now the new website is done, all the other things that have been put on hold can now begin in earnest. The big things coming up are:

*Elements 3.5.*
This is new version of the ruleset. Everything will be compatible with it but the look and feel will have changed, along with some new innovations to the rules.

*Building Plans* 
The style of the building plans have gone through many updated over the years and I am currently working on the new styles.

*New renders*
While at a recent game convention, I drew up some more Mex building levels, which will allow me to do some more renders.

So, enough to keep me going, I'm sure you'll agree! If you'd like to have some input into the rules, then please let me know on the forums.
