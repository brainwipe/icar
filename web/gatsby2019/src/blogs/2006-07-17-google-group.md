> 2019 update - the group is still there but isn't used

I've been looking at solutions to the problem of the forum. I have created an [Icar RPG Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/icarrpg) that you may all post to with your thoughts, ideas and questions! Please feel free to join up and leave your comments. As a taster, I have posted up a thread about what I'm working on at the moment]. Yuo can email the group direct: [icarrpg@googlegroups.com](icarrpg@googlegroups.com).
		
Thanks to those who offered sub-hosting on their forum systems. If the Google system proves unsuitable then I'll be in touch.
