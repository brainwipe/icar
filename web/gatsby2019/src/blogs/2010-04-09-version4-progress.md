I've been beavering away on Version 4 now for what seems like an age and it is coming together very nicely indeed. I might even go as far as to say I'm proud of it. Before I launch Version 4, I will be putting out an 'Alpha' version, which will contain most of the text and some (but not all of the images). Hopefully you can get a feel for the game from that.

For those hankering for a sneeky peek, the best place to check is the [forum](http://www.1km1kt.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=34). I have posted examples of [Tools for Sandbox Gaming](http://www.1km1kt.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=34;t=2364) from the GM Guide, changes to the horrifically out of date [Scavenger Setting](http://www.1km1kt.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=34;t=2381) and a big [To Do](http://www.1km1kt.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=34;=2283) list that acts scope for what I am creating. I post new art into my Picasaweb Art folder (closed) and also the scraps folder too</a>.

I am proud to say that there is a player group on the [forum](http://www.1km1kt.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=34) now too. They are playing Version 3.5 (that you download now) and the feedback I am getting is pure gold. I love feedback of this kind because I can go straight to the Version 4 document and change it there and then.
