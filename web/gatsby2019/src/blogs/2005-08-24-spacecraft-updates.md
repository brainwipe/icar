I have finally got around to updating the information on the space craft. Before, it was difficult to get a sense of scale of the craft. Now each space craft has the following two items:

- *Cargo*: Is the number of 10m x 10m x 10m space crates that will fit into the cargo area.
- *Dimensions*: In metres, the length, width and height of the craft.

I know there will be a desire to put more and more on these sheet but instead I will probably make some sort of master information sheet that will include loads of ridiculous technical data for those who care. For most people, what's on there now is fine.
