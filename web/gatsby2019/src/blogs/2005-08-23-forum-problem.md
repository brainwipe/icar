Some of you might be having problems accessing the forums. This problems should not persist for long, so please keep checking back.

## The Technical Reason Why
As Byrn suggested, the domain name chomisis.net ran out this August and although I paid for the webspace, I did not pay for the domain name again. The reason for this is that the domain name was registered to another email (my old Rob Lang@icar one) and so I recieved no notification. Some of the DNS servers have updated quickly with the lapse in domain name, others are more slow. 

So, if you had problems accessing the site, well done! You're on a quickly-updating DNS. I've now paid for another 2 years and so it should be back online with everyone soon.
