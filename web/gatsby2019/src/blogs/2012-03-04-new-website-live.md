The new Icar website has gone live. It comes from a [long line of websites](http://www.icar.co.uk/archive/pagehistory.php) dating back to 1996. The aim of this new site is to simplify it and to make it easy for people to get at the downloads. Now that there are only two downloads (the core rules and equipment), that's done nicely with a slider on the main page.  

This is now the best place to get news, the old xml feed is dead. You can find much of the old site in the [archive](http://www.icar.co.uk/archive) area of the site, including my design notes (with a retrospective) and the Icar toon.  

Next up for the web presence are the facebook and G+ groups. But first, some sleep!
