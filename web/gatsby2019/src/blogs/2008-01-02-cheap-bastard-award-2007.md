I hope this doesn't turn into an AGC lovefest (but it might) but I have just found out that Icar has won the [Cheap Bastard Award](http://allgamesconsidered.blogspot.com) for 2007. It's an accolade I am proud to accept and I'd like to thank AGC for pointing a spotlight at Icar. I'd also like to thank the tireless people who keep spurring me on, either by asking me lots of questions, playtesting weekly and steering me away from insane rules that sounded quite cool on a podcast. To name a few Fish, Dwain, Byrn, Wallace, Pulley and Joeyeti.
		
Many thanks (again) All Games Considered!
