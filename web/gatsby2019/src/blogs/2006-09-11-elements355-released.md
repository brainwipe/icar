Finally some big news here. The Elements (core rules) is now complete with all of its images. No longer in 'Alpha', it's complete. I have replaced the old rulebook with the new one. It's now complete and ready to use. It's a bit achievement and I'm rather proud of it.
		
For those that have been following development closely, you'll notice that the rule regarding ticking a Close Combat Fighting skill when used has gone in.

As nothing stays still for long, the next book to undergo a big change is the Society Book. I've already repaginated what's there and added a load from the Wiki. The first revision (Society 2.0 Alpha) should be out around Christmas.
