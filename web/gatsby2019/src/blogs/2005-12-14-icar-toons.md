Just a quick news item to say that there is a new Cartoon section (under Misc in the menu) with my stick cartoons. There are only four at the moment but I do intend to keep rolling them out. For those that have not been watching, they are a tribute to Richard Burlew's wonderful [Order of the Stick](http://www.giantitp.com/cgi-bin/GiantITP/ootscript) toons that I have grown to love. Enjoy!
