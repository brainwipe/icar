Not only did I accidentally delete an old news story about the RSS (you already knew anyway, surely) but I've converted the whole site over to php. Yes. PHP. Nice safe PHP. It pRob Langably works on Safari and Opera now. Not only that but it means I can do some clever code things. In my PHP5 excitement, I think I deleted the main news RSS feed. Which was not clever either. So, not my finest hour but certainly a big step forward. Not that there is anything new to look at - unless you use Safari or Opera. A more interesting and content driven News item next. I promise.
