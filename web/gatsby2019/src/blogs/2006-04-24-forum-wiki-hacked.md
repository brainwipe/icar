Unfortunately, those hacking people got into the wiki and forum and hacked it, deleting all the tables. How? I don't know. probably due to some poor coding or incorrectly setup administration. I am not, as you might understand, particularly happy about this. Thank god the tables for Chom Isis 3 are left. 
		
I am very busy at the moment and will get round to making a new forum but unfortunately, all previous content is lost. I raises the question whether to have a forum at all - especially a free one.

In the meantime, please email me at [roblang@icar.co.uk](mailto:roblang@icar.co.uk);
