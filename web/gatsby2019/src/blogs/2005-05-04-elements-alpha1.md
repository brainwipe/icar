After much brain melting, the alpha version of the Elements is ready for your perusal. The Alpha does not have many pictures and is typeset in quite a rough manner. However, it does have all of the text of the ruleset and will allow those who like to proof read and playtest early to have a go. Already there are a few things I want to add and change, so expect the version number in the file list to slowly increment! Other resources (such as a the space combat sheets) will be uploaded in the near future.

It's laid out in the new Icar style, so will look a bit different to all the other books for the moment. The others will follow suit in the near future. If you have any comments or critiques (or have found errors), the please let me know on the Forums.
