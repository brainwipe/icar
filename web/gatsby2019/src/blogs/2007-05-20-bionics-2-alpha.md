You can't breath in without me starting another Icar book and not finishing it properly. Here's another example, the Bionics 2 Alpha has just been finished. This book is really rough and ready, missing the many images it's going to need and definitely needs a good read through from those closest to the book.

The big new section is the Increment Bionics bit. This allows you to add bionics to your character bit by bit. This is instead of going for the full bionics suit. It adds more flexibility but is more than a bit complicated. So, I've created a tool that will do all the nasty maths for you. It's online and free and all the rest.

A special mention to Byrnie for helping me with this one. It's needed a lot of patience and testing to get to a point where it's at a stage for everyone to have a look. Enjoy!
