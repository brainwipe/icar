Some little updates have been happening recently. You'll have noticed that the Download section has now been split into different sections. The page before was getting a little large and so difficult to load. It needs a bit more tuning but should work for now. I know it takes a little browsing to get through all the technology but I do think that this is the best answer for the moment.

I've create a little cartoon in homage to the brilliant [Order of the Stick](http://www.giantitp.com/cgi-bin/GiantITP/ootscript) cartoon by [Richard Burlew](http://www.giantitp.com/index.html). I fancied trying my hand at some Icar sitcom. When there are a few more strips, I will probably give them their own page.

You'll notice that a few items have been added to the Equipment Index. Byrnie has done a wonderful job on the [Brainspiller 7](http://www.icar.co.uk/pics/game/equipment/brainspiller7.jpg) and [Brainspiller 7E](http://www.icar.co.uk/pics/game/equipment/brainspiller7e.jpg), even creating his own Icar company Burntek to manufacture them. Well done to him!
