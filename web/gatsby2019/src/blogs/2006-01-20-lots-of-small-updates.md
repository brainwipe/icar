A batch of updates for the New Year. All of them little, so if you're using the old versions of things don't worry too much about downloading the new versions, the changes are quite minor. If you're good with a crayon, you can always scribble on the sheet's you've printed. If you're worried about that not being 'Icar' enough, then don't worry! 

My players often have to put up with having a 'blank' weapon sheet with the stats of various weapons scrawled on them because I've forgotten to print out replacement sheets!!! Now all the updates really warrant a new version number and so cannot be found in the 'new files list'. The Nelson has been redesigned. If you want to see the steps I took, have a look on this post on the forums.

So, here are the updates:

*Weapons*
- Papex now costs 450 000
- Korg 5 encumberance now 6
- Astraripper 5b Grenade Launcher R/T now 2
- New image for Nelson H1

*Space Craft*
- Gaterunner pulse lasers now have a R/T of 50, their Damage 10K
- Cyclone price now 4 million
- Kuriaken HP fixed, Right side is now 10K
