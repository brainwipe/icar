For those who like to read and read and read, the (download.xml)next version of the Alpha] is now out. I think the only thing that it is really missing is the graphics now and that's going to take a while. If you're really interested in playing 3.5, then this book should do you. Please have a good read through and see if there is anything big that's missing. There will always be small changes but it's the big omissions I want to get in before I start typesetting with the graphics.

Having recently discovered some great features in the DTP package I use, I have managed to make a rather cool index in the back, which should make finding rules all the easier. Now comes the long slog of doing images and renders for the new rules. You might have noticed the new (download.xml)Anchorage] (replacement model from one I lost), you can expect a load more renders popping up in the near future now this version of the Alpha has finished.

Hot on the coat tails of the Elements alpha will be version 2 of Society. If any book really needs an overhaul, it's this one. Expect to see some threads in the forum about what is or is not missing in it. I will also be adding to the Equipment Index but it is likely to be kept in the old style - at least for now. There's lots missing from it - automatons and Gaia entities to name but a few.

Something else worth mentioning is that I have updated the links section too. If you'd like a link to your website, then please contact me. I can't guarantee that I'll add your site but I certainly will give it a good looking over!

Finally, I am going to be giving Paulo some help over on the Italian Website to bring its style into line with this one. Seeing as it's all XML, it should be easy for him to edit in the future!
