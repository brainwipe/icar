You don't have me to thank for this. You have Dwain, Byrn, Fish, Pete and all the other Icar players for nagging me for the past few years to create a single zip file of all the weapon items in one place. It's about time I did it. 

Perhaps next there will be a single zip with everything in it. That might get onto Torrent sites for you to download with ease. Legal too. The zip is on each of the Equipment Pages on the right hand side (see left). I've not versioned it, if you think it's needed, let me know.
