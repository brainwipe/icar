I have moved the Icar forum over to [One Thousand Monkeys, One Thousand Typewriters (1KM1KT)](http://www.1km1kt.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=34) to bring Icar into the Free RPG community a little more and to generate more traffic. It also gives me one less place to Administer. The 1KM1KTers are a friendly bunch and the forum ebbs and flows like any other. I have already [posted up a WIP example of a page](http://www.1km1kt.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=34;t=1911) of the new Equipment Index. The old forum link should redirect you. Please update your bookmarks.

I have not lost any of the content from the old forum, I have backed it up locally and have copied it all into a big XML file that I can use for reference. Thank you to everyone who posted there, I hope you find the new Icar Forum home as agreeable as I do.
