You are a proud member of Recon Squad 2 of Trooper Unit 555 operating from the Star Clipper Orionâ€™s Scabbard. Your job is to protect the human race from the onslaught of the Droids. In this setting you will start with the odds against you and use ingenuity, technology and firepower to fight your way back to rejoin the Fleet.  

You will make difficult choices, bring down orbital bombardments, direct Stub Wing strafing runs, commandeer civilian resources, fight pirates, drag crippled spacecraft into life, detonate planets, cajole civilian spacecraft Captains, battle Droids and the scum of humanity.
