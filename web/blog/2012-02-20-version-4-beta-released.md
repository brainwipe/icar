I've been throwing huge amounts of spare time into the up and coming release of Icar version 4. I've just completed the beta version that you can find on [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B2ThEbOVGt78NTI0NTY5YWUtZjVjNi00Nzc0LWJkMmYtNWZhMjZjZTU0ZWMx).  

The next steps for the game will be more graphics and a read-through by a proof reader (my wife) - the text and content is pretty much there. As always, I love feedback, the best place to give it is on [the forum](http://www.1km1kt.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=34).   

## Find Icar on Twitter

I have set up a [Twitter account](http://www.twitter.com/icarrpg) for Icar. I will be using it to post small updates and answer quick fire questions. 

## New website in the works

I have been working on a brand new website, which will arrive before version 4. Core to the new page will be a blog that will serve as a news feed. I will be creating Facebook and Google+ pages too so that I can become better integrated with fans.
